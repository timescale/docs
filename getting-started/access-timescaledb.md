# Access your database

Now that you have TimescaleDB setup and running in Timescale Forge, it's time
to connect to your database. While this can be accomplished with many tools, `psql`
is the standard command line interface for interacting with a PostgreSQL 
or TimescaleDB instance.

Below, we'll verify that you have `psql` installed and show you how to connect
to your TimescaleDB database.

## Verify that `psql` is installed
**Before you start**, let's confirm that you already have `psql` installed. 
In fact, if youâ€™ve ever installed Postgres or TimescaleDB before, you likely already 
have `psql` installed.

In a command line or terminal window, type the following command and press **Enter**.
If `psql` is installed, it will return the version number. Otherwise, you will
receive an error.

```bash
psql --version
```

<highlight type="tip">
If your client doesn't have `psql` installed, follow the instructions provided
in our How-to guides for [Installing `psql`](/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/connecting/psql/) and then return here.

## Connect to your TimescaleDB server
Now that we've confirmed that `psql` is installed, it's time to connect to your
Timescale Forge instance.

In Timescale Forge, open the **Service Details** by clicking on the service
that you created in [Step 1][launch-timescaledb].

Copy the **Service URL** from the information displayed. This service URL contains
all of the information to connect to your new service *_except_* the password.

In a terminal window, type the following command, substituting the **Service URL**
that you just copied for the sample URL shown below:

```bash
psql postgres://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[HOSTNAME]:[PORT]/[DATABASENAME]?sslmode=require
```

<highlight type="tip">
Because the URL provided in the Timescale Forge interface does not supply the 
password, you will be prompted for the password in order to finish authenticating.

If you want to save yourself time, you can add the password to the URL by adding
a colon and the password between the username and the hostname as shown
in the placeholder above

Now that you've connected to your Timescale Forge service, let's look at how to
quickly add data so that you can quickly start to explore the power of TimescaleDB.
