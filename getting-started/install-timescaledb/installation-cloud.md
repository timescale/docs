# Timescale Cloud

Timescale Cloud is a Database as a Service (DBaaS) offering that provides
an easy way for you to store and analyze time-series.
Powered by TimescaleDB, you can create database instances in the cloud
and automate many of your most common operational tasks.

You can register for a Timescale Cloud account on the
[sign up][sign-up] page. Once you have a login, you can access
the Timescale Cloud [portal][portal].

After you create an account and login for the first time,
a default project is created for you. In this project is where
you create your first TimescaleDB service.

Timescale Cloud automatically gives you access to all the features
and capabilities in [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/products).

Now that your database account is setup, it's time to
