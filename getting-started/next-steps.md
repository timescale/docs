# Next steps
Now that you've had some hands-on experience with TimescaleDB, hopefully you can
see how many of Timescale's powerful features can help you manage your
time-series data while easily mining for deeper insights. ðŸ’¥

To continue your exploration of TimescaleDB, here are some valuable next steps
to help you on your way to becoming a time-series superhero.

## Migrate data to TimescaleDB
One of the first things most developers want to do is look at the data they're
currently working with in the database. There are a number of methods for
importing data that you currently have, whether it exists in another database
or a .csv file.

Look at the [how-to guide on Migrating Data][migrate-data] for more help and
suggestions of where to start.

## Ingest real-time data
Working with sample data can teach you a lot about TimescaleDB, but you might
be interested to ingest market data real-time. Check out our
complementing tutorial
[Ingest real-time financial websocket data][ingest-real-time] and continue
ingesting data driectly from the [Twelve Data][twelve-data] financial API.

## Visualize your data
Time-series data is perfectly suited for viewing with tools like Grafana,
Tableau, and Power BI, to name a few. Once you can see trends and query
for specific data features using relational data, a whole new world of insights
begins to open up.

Check out the [growing set of visualization tutorials][visualize-data], showing
you how to become a Grafana Superhero and connect to other third party
visualization tools.

## Connect to your data with code
While this may be the century of big data, the greatest power often happens in
connected applications that help turn data into value to users. Using
time-series data effectively means you need to get your code connected and
working as efficiently as possible.

See the [growing list of language Quick Starts][connect-with-code] to get you up
and running with TimescaleDB, including best practices.

## Examine other sample datasets
Sometimes it's just easier to explore further by having access to additional
datasets. We have you covered! ðŸ™Œ

Have a look some of the [other datasets][sample-data] provided for you to dig
deeper into time-series data and data analysis using TimescaleDB.
