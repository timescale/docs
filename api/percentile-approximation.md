# Percentile approximation  <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag>
This section contains functions related to percentile approximation.
Approximation algorithms are used to calculate a percentile without requiring
all of the data. For more information about percentile approximation functions,
see the [hyperfunctions documentation][hyperfunctions-percentile-approx].

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.
