# Time-weighted average functions <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag>
This section contains functions related to time-weighted averages and integrals.
Time weighted averages and integrals are commonly used in cases where a time
series is not evenly sampled, so a traditional average gives misleading results.
For more information about these functions, see the
[hyperfunctions documentation][hyperfunctions-time-weight-average].

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.
