# Time-weighted average functions <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag>
This section contains functions related to time-weighted averages. Time weighted
averages are commonly used in cases where a time series is not evenly sampled,
so a traditional average gives misleading results. For more information
about time-weighted average functions, see the
[hyperfunctions documentation][hyperfunctions-time-weight-average].

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.
