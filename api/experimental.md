# Experimental

TimescaleDB exposes some experimental functionality to get early feedback from 
the users. Corresponding functions, VIEWs, etc are available in 
`timescaledb_experimental` schema. Please note that all experimental features 
are **dangerous** in terms that they may have bugs, don't guarantee any 
backward compatibility, and may be deleted in future releases. Use at your 
own risk!
