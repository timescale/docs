# Experimental

TimescaleDB includes some experimental functionality to get early feedback from
users. These experimental functions are available in the `timescaledb_experimental`
schema. 

<highlight="warning">
Experimental features could have bugs! They might not be backwards compatible,
and could be removed in future releases. Use these features at your own risk, and
do not use any experimental features in production.
