# Financial analysis

These specialized hyperfunctions make it easier to write financial analysis
queries. They help you answer questions such as:

*   What are the opening and closing prices of these stocks?
*   When did the highest price occur for this stock?

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the [Timescale
Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

<hyperfunctionTable
