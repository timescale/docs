# Administrative Functions

These administrative APIs help you prepare a database before and after a restore event. They also help you keep track of your TimescaleDB setup data.

## Dump TimescaleDB meta data

To help when asking for support and reporting bugs, TimescaleDB includes an SQL dump script. It outputs metadata from the internal TimescaleDB tables, along with version information.

This script is available in the source distribution in `scripts/`. To use it, run:

```bash
psql [your connect flags] -d your_timescale_db < dump_meta_data.sql > dumpfile.txt
```

Inspect `dumpfile.txt` before sending it together with a bug report or support question.

## get_telemetry_report()

Returns the background [telemetry][telemetry] string sent to Timescale servers. 

If telemetry is turned off, it sends the string that would be sent if telemetry were enabled.

### Sample usage

View the telemetry report:

```sql
SELECT get_telemetry_report();
```

## timescaledb_post_restore()

Perform the required operations after you have finished restoring the database using `pg_restore`. Specifically, this resets the `timescaledb.restoring` GUC and restarts any background workers. 

For more information, see [Migrate using pg_dump and pg_restore].

### Sample usage

Prepare the database for normal use after a restore:

```sql
SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();
```

## timescaledb_pre_restore()

Perform the required operations so that you can restore the database using `pg_restore`. Specifically, this sets the `timescaledb.restoring` GUC to `on` and stops any background workers which could have been performing tasks. 

The background workers are stopped until the [timescaledb_post_restore()](#timescaledb_post_restore) function is run, after the restore operation is complete.

For more information, see [Migrate using pg_dump and pg_restore].

<Highlight type="important">
After using `timescaledb_pre_restore()`, you need to run [`timescaledb_post_restore()`](#timescaledb_post_restore) before you can use the database normally.
</Highlight>

### Sample usage

Prepare to restore the database:

```sql
SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();
```
