# Informational Views
TimescaleDB makes complex database features like partitioning and data retention
easy to use with our comprehensive APIs. TimescaleDB works hard to provide
detailed information about the state of your data, hypertables, chunks, and any
jobs or policies you have in place.

These views provide the data and statistics you need to keep track of your
database.
