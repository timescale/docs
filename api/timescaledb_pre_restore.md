## timescaledb_pre_restore() 

Perform the proper operations to allow restoring of the database via `pg_restore` to commence.
Specifically this sets the `timescaledb.restoring` GUC to `on` and stops any
background workers which may have been performing tasks until the [`timescaledb_post_restore`](/administration/timescaledb_post_restore/)
function is run following the restore. See [backup/restore docs][backup-restore] for more information.

<highlight type="warning">
 Using this function when doing an upgrade could cause issues in TimescaleDB 
 versions before 1.7.1.
</highlight>

<highlight type="warning">
 After running `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore()` you must run the
  [`timescaledb_post_restore`](/api/latest/administration/timescaledb_post_restore/) function before using 
  the database normally.

### Sample Usage

SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();
