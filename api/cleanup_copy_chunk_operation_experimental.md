## cleanup_copy_chunk_operation() <tag type="community">Community</tag> <tag type="experimental">Experimental</tag>

You can [copy][copy_chunk] or [move][move_chunk] a
chunk to a new location within a multi-node environment. The
operation happens over multiple transactions so, if it fails, it
is manually cleaned up using this function. Without cleanup,
the failed operation might hold a replication slot open, which in turn
prevents storage from being reclaimed. The operation ID is logged in
case of a failed copy or move operation and is required as input to
the cleanup function.
