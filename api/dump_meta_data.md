## Dump TimescaleDB meta data 

To help when asking for support and reporting bugs,
TimescaleDB includes a SQL script that outputs metadata
from the internal TimescaleDB tables as well as version information.
The script is available in the source distribution in `scripts/`.
To use it, run:

```bash
psql [your connect flags] -d your_timescale_db < dump_meta_data.sql > dumpfile.txt
```

and then inspect `dump_file.txt` before sending it together with a bug report or support question.
