  summary: |
    Get a state of all states, showing each time a state is entered and exited.

    across interval boundaries, use [`interpolated_state_timeline`](#interpolated_state_timeline).
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        state_timeline(
            agg StateAgg
        ) RETURNS (TEXT, TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPTZ)

        state_int_state(
            agg StateAgg
        ) RETURNS (BIGINT, TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPTZ)
  parameters:

          SELECT state, start_time, end_time
            FROM toolkit_experimental.state_timeline(
