api_details:
  summary: |
    Given a state aggregate and a specific state, list the periods when the
    system is in that state. Periods are defined by the start time and end
    time.

    If you have multiple state aggregates and need to interpolate the state
    across interval boundaries, use [`interpolated_state_periods`](#interpolated_state_periods).
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        state_periods(
            state [TEXT | BIGINT],
            agg StateAgg
        ) RETURNS (TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPTZ)
  parameters:
    required:
      - name: state
        type: TEXT | BIGINT
        description: The target state to get data for.
      - name: agg
        type: StateAgg
        description: A state aggregate created using [`state_agg`](#state_agg).
    returns:
      - column: start_time
        type: TIMESTAMPTZ
        description: The time when the state started (inclusive)
      - column: end_time
        type: TIMESTAMPTZ
        description: The time when the state ended (exclusive)
  examples:
    - description: >
        Create a state aggregate and list all periods corresponding to the
        state `OK`.
      command:
        code: |
          SELECT start_time, end_time FROM toolkit_experimental.state_periods(
            'OK',
            (SELECT toolkit_experimental.state_agg(ts, state) FROM states_test)
          );
      return:
        code: |2
                 start_time       |        end_time
