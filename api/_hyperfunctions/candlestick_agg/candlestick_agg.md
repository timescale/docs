  summary: |
    This is the first step for performing financial calculations on raw tick
    data. Use `candlestick_agg` to create an intermediate aggregate from your
    tick data. This intermediate form can then be used by one or more accessors
    in this group to compute final results.
    
    Optionally, multiple such intermediate aggregate objects can be combined
    using [`rollup()`](#rollup) before an accessor is applied.

    If you're starting with pre-aggregated candlestick data rather than raw tick
    data, use the companion [`candlestick()`](#candlestick) function instead.
    This function transforms the existing aggregated data into the correct form
    for use with the candlestick accessors.
