excerpt: Get the total time live from a heartbeat aggregate and predecessor

api_details:
  summary: |
    This behaves very similarly to [`uptime()`](#uptime), but it also takes the heartbeat aggregate from the preceding interval.  It checks when the last heartbeat in the predecessor was received and makes sure that the entire heartbeat interval after that is considered live. This addresses the issue where `uptime` would consider the interval between the start of the interval and the first heartbeat as dead.
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        interpolated_uptime(
            agg HEARTBEATAGG,
            pred HEARTBEATAGG
        ) RETURNS INTERVAL
  parameters:
    required:
      - name: agg
        type: HeartbeatAgg
        description: >
          A heartbeat aggregate to get the liveness data from.
    optional:
      - name: pred
        type: HeartbeatAgg
        description: >
          The heartbeat aggregate for the interval before the one being measured, if one exists.
    returns:
      - column: interpolated_uptime
        type: INTERVAL
        description: >
          The sum of all the live ranges in the aggregate, including those covered by the last heartbeat of the previous interval.
  examples:
    - description: >
        Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`, you can use this command to get the total interpolated uptime of the system during the week of Jan 9, 2022.
      command:
        code: |
          SELECT interpolated_uptime(
            health,
            LAG(health) OVER (ORDER BY date)
          )
          FROM liveness
          WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
      return:
        code: |
          interpolated_uptime
