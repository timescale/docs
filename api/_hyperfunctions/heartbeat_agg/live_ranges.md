    interval of the aggregate.
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        live_ranges(
            agg HEARTBEATAGG
        ) RETURNS TABLE (

    required:
      - name: agg

        description: >
          A heartbeat aggregate to get the liveness data from.
    returns:
      - column: live_ranges
        type: TABLE (start TIMESTAMPTZ, end TIMESTAMPTZ)
        description: >
          The (start, end) pairs of when the system was live.
  examples:
    - description: >
        Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`, we can use the following to get the intervals where the system was live during the week of Jan 9, 2022.
      command:
        code: |
          SELECT live_ranges(health)
          FROM liveness
          WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
      return:

                              live_ranges
