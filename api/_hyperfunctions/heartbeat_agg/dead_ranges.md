api_details:
  summary: |
    Given a heartbeat aggregate, this will return a set of (start_time,
    end_time) pairs representing when the underlying system did not have a
    valid heartbeat during the interval of the aggregate.
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        dead_ranges(
            agg HEARTBEATAGG
        ) RETURNS TABLE (
            start TIMESTAMPTZ,
            end TIMESTAMPTZ

    required:
      - name: agg
        type: HeartbeatAgg
        description: >
          A heartbeat aggregate to get the liveness data from.
    returns:
      - column: dead_ranges
        type: TABLE (start TIMESTAMPTZ, end TIMESTAMPTZ)
        description: >
          The (start, end) pairs of when the system was down.
  examples:
    - description: >
        Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`, we can use the following to get the intervals where the system was down during the week of Jan 9, 2022.
      command:
        code: |
          SELECT dead_ranges(health)
          FROM liveness
          WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
      return:
