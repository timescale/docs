  summary: >
    Calculate the average from a two-dimensional aggregate tfor the given
    dimension. For example, `average_y()` calculates the average for all the
    values of the `y` variable, independent of the values of the `x` variable.
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        average_y(
          summary StatsSummary 2D
        ) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
    - language: sql
      code: |
        average_x(
          summary StatsSummary 2D
        ) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION

    required:
      - name: summary
        type: StatsSummary2D
        description: >
          The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call
    returns:
      - column: average_y | average_x
        type: DOUBLE PRECISION
        description: >
          The average of the values in the statistical aggregate
  examples:
    - description: >
        Calculate the average of the integers from 0 to 100.
      command:
        language: sql
        code: |
          SELECT average_x(stats_agg(y, x))
            FROM generate_series(1, 5) y,
                 generate_series(0, 100) x;
      return:
