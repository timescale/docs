  summary: >
    This is the first step for performing any statistical aggregate calculations
    on two-dimensional data. Use `stats_agg` to create an intermediate aggregate
    (`StatsSummary2D`) from your data. This intermediate form can then be used
    by one or more accessors in this group to compute the final results.
    Optionally, multiple such intermediate aggregate objects can be combined
    using [`rollup()`](#rollup) or [`rolling()`](#rolling) before an accessor is
    applied.

        type: StatsSummary2D
        description: >
          The statistical aggregate, containing data about the variables in an
          intermediate form. Pass the aggregate to accessor functions in the
          statistical aggregates API to perform final calculations. Or, pass the
          aggregate to rollup functions to combine multiple statistical aggregates
          into larger aggregates.

Perform common statistical analyses, such as averaging and linear regression,
using this group of functions. These functions are similar to the [PostgreSQL
statistical aggregates][pg-stats-aggs], but they include more features and are
easier to use in [continuous aggregates][caggs] and window functions.

They work with both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) data. For
example, you can calculate the average of a single variable (1D), or the slope
of two related variables (2D).
