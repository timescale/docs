  parameters:
    required:
      - name: summary
        type: StatsSummary1D
        description: >
          The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call
    optional:
      - name: method
        type: TEXT
        description: >
          The method used for calculating the standard deviation. The two options
          are `population` and `sample`, which can be abbreviated to `pop` or
          `samp`. Defaults to `sample`.
    returns:
      - column: variance
