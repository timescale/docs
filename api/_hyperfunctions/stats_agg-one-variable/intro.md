section: hyperfunction
subsection: stats_agg() (one variable)
---

Perform common statistical analyses, such as calculating averages and standard
deviations, using this group of functions. These functions are similar to the
[PostgreSQL statistical aggregates][pg-stats-aggs], but they include more
features and are easier to use in [continuous aggregates][caggs] and window
functions.

These functions work on one-dimensional data. To work with two-dimensional data,
for example to perform linear regression, see [the two-dimensional `stats_agg`
functions][stats_agg-2d].
