  summary: >
    Calculate the standard deviation from the values in a statistical aggregate.
  signatures:
    - language: sql
      code: |
        stddev(
          summary StatsSummary1D,
          [ method TEXT ]
        ) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
  parameters:
    required:
      - name: summary
        type: StatsSummary1D
        description: >
          The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call
    optional:
      - name: method
        type: TEXT
        description: >
          The method used for calculating the standard deviation. The two options
          are `population` and `sample`, which can be abbreviated to `pop` or
          `samp`. Defaults to `sample`.
    returns:
      - column: stddev
        type: DOUBLE PRECISION
        description: >
          The standard deviation of the values in the statistical aggregate
  examples:
    - description: >
          Calculate the standard deviation of a sample containing the integers from 0 to 100.
      command:
