# state_agg()  <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag><tag type="experimental-toolkit">Experimental</tag>
The `state_agg` aggregate measures the amount of time spent in each 
distinct value of a state field. It is designed to work with a relatively small 
number of states and might not perform well on queries where states are 
mostly distinct across rows.

## Required arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`ts`|`TIMESTAMPTZ`|Column of timestamps|
|`value`|`TEXT`|Column of states|

## Returns

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`stateagg`|`stateagg`|An object storing the total time spent in each state.|

## Sample usage
This example creates a state aggregate over a `status` column in a `devices`
table, with a timestamp column `time`.
```sql
CREATE toolkit_experimental.state_agg(time, status) FROM devices;
```
