# state_agg()  <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag><tag type="experimental">Experimental</tag>
The `state_agg` aggregate measures the amount of time spent in each 
distinct value of a state field. It is designed to work with a relatively small 
number of states and might not perform well on queries where states are 
mostly distinct across rows.

Experimental features could have bugs! They might not be backwards compatible,
and could be removed in future releases. Use these features at your own risk, and
do not use any experimental features in production.
