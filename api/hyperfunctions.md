# Hyperfunctions

TimescaleDB hyperfunctions are a series of SQL functions within TimescaleDB that 
make it easier to manipulate and analyze time-series data in PostgreSQL with 
fewer lines of code. You can use hyperfunctions to easily aggregate data into
consistent buckets of time, calculate percentile approximations of data, compute 
time-weighted averages, downsample and smooth data, and perform faster COUNT DISTINCT 
queries using approximations. 

Hyperfunctions are “easy” to use: you call a hyperfunction using the same SQL 
syntax you know and love.
