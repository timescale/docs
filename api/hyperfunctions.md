# Hyperfunctions

Timescale hyperfunctions are a specialized set of functions that allow you to
analyze time-series data. You can use hyperfunctions to analyze anything you
have stored as time-series data, including IoT devices, IT systems, marketing
analytics, user behavior, financial metrics, and cryptocurrency.

Some hyperfunctions are included by default in Timescale. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

For more information, see the [hyperfunctions
documentation][hyperfunctions-howto].
