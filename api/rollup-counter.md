# rollup(CounterSummary) <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag>

```SQL
rollup(
    cs CounterSummary
) RETURNS CounterSummary
```

An aggregate to compute a combined `CounterSummary` from a series of
non-overlapping `CounterSummaries`. Non-disjointed `CounterSummaries` cause
errors.

For more information about counter aggregation functions, see the
[hyperfunctions documentation][hyperfunctions-counter-agg].

## Required arguments

|Name| Type |Description|
|-|-|-|
|`cs`|CounterSummary|The input CounterSummary from a previous `counter_agg` (point form) call, often from a continuous aggregate|

## Returns

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`counter_agg`|CounterSummary|A CounterSummary object that can be passed to accessor functions or other objects in the counter aggregate API|


## Sample usage

```SQL
WITH t as (
    SELECT
        date_trunc('day', ts) as dt,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS counter_summary -- get a time weight summary
    FROM foo
    WHERE id = 'bar'
    GROUP BY date_trunc('day')
), q as (
    SELECT rollup(counter_summary) AS full_cs -- do a second level of aggregation to get the full CounterSummary
    FROM t
)
SELECT
    dt,
    delta(counter_summary),  -- extract the delta from the  CounterSummary
    delta(counter_summary) / (SELECT delta(full_cs) FROM q LIMIT 1)  as normalized -- get the fraction of the delta that happened each day compared to the full change of the counter
FROM t;
```
