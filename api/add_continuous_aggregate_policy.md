# add_continuous_aggregate_policy() <tag type="community">Community</tag>

Create a policy that automatically refreshes a continuous aggregate. To view the
policies that you set or the policies that already exist, see
[informational views][informational-views].

### Required arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`continuous_aggregate`|REGCLASS|The continuous aggregate to add the policy for|
|`start_offset`|INTERVAL or integer|Start of the refresh window as an interval relative to the time when the policy is executed. `NULL` is equivalent to `MIN(timestamp)` of the hypertable.|
|`end_offset`|INTERVAL or integer|End of the refresh window as an interval relative to the time when the policy is executed. `NULL` is equivalent to `MAX(timestamp)` of the hypertable.|
|`schedule_interval`|INTERVAL|Interval between refresh executions in wall-clock time. Defaults to 24 hours|
|`initial_start`|TIMESTAMPTZ|Time the policy is first run. Defaults to NULL. If omitted, then the schedule interval is the intervalbetween the finish time of the last execution and the next start. If provided, it serves as the origin with respect to which the next_start is calculated |
|`timezone`|TEXT|A valid time zone. If `initial_start` is also specified, subsequent executions of the refresh policy will be aligned on its initial start. However, daylight savings time (DST) changes may shift this alignment. Set to a valid time zone if this is an issue you want to mitigate. If omitted, UTC bucketing is performed. Defaults to `NULL`.|

The `start_offset` should be greater than `end_offset`.

You must specify the `start_offset` and `end_offset` parameters differently,
depending on the type of the time column of the hypertable:

*   For hypertables with `TIMESTAMP`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, and `DATE` time columns,
    set the offset as an `INTERVAL` type.
*   For hypertables with integer-based timestamps, set the offset as an
    `INTEGER` type.

<highlight type="important">
While setting `end_offset` to `NULL` is possible, it is not recommended. By
default, querying a continuous aggregate returns data between `end_offset` and
the current time. There is no need to set `end_offset` to `NULL`. To learn more
about how continuous aggregates use real-time aggregation, see the
[real-time aggregation section](/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/continuous-aggregates/real-time-aggregates/).

### Optional arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`if_not_exists`|BOOLEAN|Set to `true` to issue a notice instead of an error if the job does not exist. Defaults to false.|

### Returns

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`job_id`|INTEGER|TimescaleDB background job ID created to implement this policy|

### Sample use

Add a policy that refreshes the last month once an hour, excluding the latest
hour from the aggregate. For performance reasons, we recommend that you
exclude buckets that see lots of writes:

```sql
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('conditions_summary',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '1 month',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour');
```
