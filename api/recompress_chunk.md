# recompress_chunk() <tag type="community" content="Community" />
Recompresses a compressed chunk that had more data inserted after compression.
```sql
recompress_chunk(
    chunk REGCLASS,
    if_not_compressed BOOLEAN = false
)
```

You can also recompress chunks by 
[running the job associated with your compression policy][run-job]. 
`recompress_chunk` gives you more fine-grained control by 
allowing you to target a specific chunk.

<highlight type="important">
`recompress_chunk` is implemented as an SQL procedure and not a function. Call
the procedure with `CALL`. Don't use a `SELECT` statement.
</highlight>

<highlight type="note">
`recompress_chunk` only works on chunks that have previously been compressed. To compress a
chunk for the first time, use [`compress_chunk`](/api/latest/compression/compress_chunk/).

## Required arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`chunk`|`REGCLASS`|The chunk to be recompressed. Must include the schema, for example `_timescaledb_internal`, if it is not in the search path.|

## Optional arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`if_not_compressed`|`BOOLEAN`|If `true`, prints a notice instead of erroring if the chunk is already compressed. Defaults to `false`.|

## Sample usage
Recompress the chunk `timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk`:
```sql
CALL recompress_chunk('_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk');
```

## Troubleshooting
In TimescaleDB 2.6.0 and above, `recompress_chunk` is implemented as a procedure.
Previously, it was implemented as a function. If you are upgrading to
TimescaleDB 2.6.0 or above, the`recompress_chunk` 
function could cause an error. For example, trying to run `SELECT
recompress_chunk(i.show_chunks, true) FROM...` gives the following error:
```sql
ERROR:  recompress_chunk(regclass, boolean) is a procedure
```

To fix the error, use `CALL` instead of `SELECT`. You might also need to write a
procedure to replace the full functionality in your `SELECT` statement. For
example:
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE chunk regclass;
BEGIN
  FOR chunk IN SELECT format('%I.%I', chunk_schema, chunk_name)::regclass
  FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
  WHERE is_compressed = true
  LOOP
    RAISE NOTICE 'Recompressing %', chunk::text;
    CALL recompress_chunk(chunk, true);
  END LOOP;
END
$$;
```
