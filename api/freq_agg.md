# freq_agg()  <tag type="toolkit">Toolkit</tag><tag type="experimental">Experimental</tag>
The `freq_agg` aggregate uses the [SpaceSaving][spacesaving-algorithm] algorithm 
to estimate the most common elements of a set. This API takes a sizing parameter and 
a PostgreSQL column, and returns a FreqAgg object that can be passed to 
[other freq_agg APIs][frequency-analysis].

<highlight type="warning">
Experimental features could have bugs. They might not be backwards compatible,
and could be removed in future releases. Use these features at your own risk, and
do not use any experimental features in production.

## Required arguments

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`freq`|`DOUBLE PRECISION`|Minimum frequency (0.0-1.0) needed to keep track of a value|
|`value`|`AnyElement`|Column to aggregate|

## Returns
|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`agg`|`SpaceSavingAggregate`|An object storing the most common elements of the given table and their estimated frequency.|

## Sample usage
This example creates frequency aggregate over a field `ZIP` in a `HomeSales`
table. This aggregate tracks any `ZIP` value that occurs in at least 5% of rows.
```sql
CREATE toolkit_experimental.freq_agg(0.05, ZIP) FROM HomeSales;
```
