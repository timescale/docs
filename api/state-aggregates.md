# State aggregates

This section includes functions used to measure the time spent in a relatively small number of states.

For these hyperfunctions, you need to install the [TimescaleDB Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

## Notes on compact_state_agg and state_agg

`state_agg` supports all hyperfunctions that operate on CompactStateAggs, in addition
to some additional functions that need a full state timeline.

All `compact_state_agg` and `state_agg` hyperfunctions support both string (`TEXT`) and integer (`BIGINT`) states.
You can't mix different types of states within a single aggregate.
Integer states are useful when the state value is a foreign key representing a row in another table that stores all possible states.
