# State aggregates

This section includes functions used to measure the time spent in a relatively small number of states.

For these hyperfunctions, you need to install the [TimescaleDB Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

<hyperfunctionTable
    hyperfunctionFamily='state aggregates'
    includeExperimental
    sortByType
/>
