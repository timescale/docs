# Frequency analysis

This section includes frequency aggregate APIs, which find the most common elements out of a set of
vastly more varied values.

For these hyperfunctions, you need to install the [TimescaleDB Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

<HyperfunctionTable
    hyperfunctionFamily='frequency analysis'

    sortByType
