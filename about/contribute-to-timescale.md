# Contributing to Timescale

There are multiple ways to help make TimescaleDB better. All of the documentation
and source for the PostgreSQL extension are available to use and review on
GitHub.

## Contributing to Timescale documentation

Timescale documentation is hosted in a [GitHub repository][github-docs]
and is open for contribution from all community members. If you
find errors or would like to add content to the docs, this tutorial
walks you through the process.

### Making minor changes

If you want to make only minor changes to docs, you can make corrections
and submit pull requests on the GitHub website. Go to the file you want to
correct and click the 'pencil' icon to edit. Once done, GitHub gives you
an option to submit a pull request at the bottom of the page.

### Making larger contributions to docs

In order to modify documentation, you should have a working knowledge
of [git][install-git] and [Markdown][markdown-tutorial]. You
also need to create a GitHub account.

Be sure to read the [Timescale docs contribution styleguide][timescale-docs-style].
You'll see information about how we refer to aspects of Timescale,
how we format our docs, and special Markdown tags available to
you as you author your contribution.

Before we accept any contributions, Timescale contributors need to
sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). By signing a CLA, we
can ensure that the community is free and confident in its
ability to use your contributions. You are prompted to sign the
CLA during the pull request process.
