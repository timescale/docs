All the latest features and updates to Timescale products.

## üèÑ Optimizations for compressed data and extended join support in continuous aggregates
<Label type="date">August 15, 2024</Label>

TimescaleDB v2.16.0 contains significant performance improvements when working with compressed data, extended join
support in continuous aggregates, and the ability to define foreign keys from regular tables towards hypertables.

Any new service created on Timescale Cloud starting today uses TimescaleDB v2.16.0.

In TimescaleDB v2.16.0 we:

* Introduced multiple performance focused optimizations for data manipulation operations (DML) over compressed chunks.

  Improved upsert performance by more than 100x in some cases and more than 1000x in some update/delete scenarios.

* Added the ability to define chunk skipping indexes on non-partitioning columns of compressed hypertables.

  TimescaleDB v2.16.0 extends chunk exclusion to use these skipping (sparse) indexes when queries filter on the relevant columns,
  and prune chunks that do not include any relevant data for calculating the query response.

* Offered new options for use cases that require foreign keys defined.

  You can now add foreign keys from regular tables towards hypertables. We have also removed
  some really annoying locks in the reverse direction that blocked access to referenced tables
  while compression was running.

* Extended Continuous Aggregates to support more types of analytical queries.

  More types of joins are supported, additional equality operators on join clauses, and
  support for joins between multiple regular tables.

**Highlighted features in this release**

* Improved query performance through chunk exclusion on compressed hypertables.

  You can now define chunk skipping indexes on compressed chunks for any column with one of the following
  integer data types: `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, `serial`, `bigserial`, `date`, `timestamp`, `timestamptz`.

  After calling `enable_chunk_skipping` on a column, TimescaleDB tracks the min and max values for
  that column, using this information to exclude chunks for queries filtering on that
  column, where no data would be found.

* Improved upsert performance on compressed hypertables.

  By using index scans to verify constraints during inserts on compressed chunks, TimescaleDB speeds
  up some ON CONFLICT clauses by more than 100x.

* Improved performance of updates, deletes, and inserts on compressed hypertables.

  By filtering data while accessing the compressed data and before decompressing, TimescaleDB has
  improved performance for updates and deletes on all types of compressed chunks, as well as inserts
  into compressed chunks with unique constraints.

  By signaling constraint violations without decompressing, or decompressing only when matching
  records are found in the case of updates, deletes and upserts, TimescaleDB v2.16.0 speeds
  up those operations more than 1000x in some update/delete scenarios, and 10x for upserts.

* You can add foreign keys from regular tables to hypertables, with support for all types of cascading options.
  This is useful for hypertables that partition using sequential IDs, and need to reference these IDs from other tables.

* Lower locking requirements during compression for hypertables with foreign keys

  Advanced foreign key handling removes the need for locking referenced tables when new chunks are compressed.
  DML is no longer blocked on referenced tables while compression runs on a hypertable.

* Improved support for queries on Continuous Aggregates

  `INNER/LEFT` and `LATERAL` joins are now supported. Plus, you can now join with multiple regular tables,
  and have more than one equality operator on join clauses.

**PostgreSQL 13 support removal announcement**

Following the deprecation announcement for PostgreSQL 13 in TimescaleDB v2.13,
PostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.

The currently supported PostgreSQL major versions are 14, 15, and 16.
 
## üì¶ Performance, packaging and stability improvements for Timescale Cloud
<Label type="date">August 8, 2024</Label>

### New plans
To support evolving customer needs, Timescale Cloud now offers three plans to provide more value, flexibility, and efficiency.
- **Performance:** for cost-focused, smaller projects. No credit card required to start.
- **Scale:** for developers handling critical and demanding apps.
- **Enterprise:** for enterprises with mission-critical apps.

Each plan continues to bill based on hourly usage, primarily for compute you run and storage you consume.  You can upgrade or downgrade between Performance and Scale plans via the Console UI at any time.  More information about the specifics and differences between these pricing plans can be found [here in the docs](https://docs.timescale.com/about/latest/pricing-and-account-management/).

Ollama is now integrated with [pgai](https://github.com/timescale/pgai).

Ollama is the easiest and most popular way to get up and running with open-source 
language models. Think of Ollama as _Docker for LLMs_, enabling easy access and usage 
of a variety of open-source models like Llama 3, Mistral, Phi 3, Gemma, and more. 

With the pgai extension integrated in your database, embed Ollama AI into your app using
SQL. For example:

```sql
select ollama_generate
( 'llava:7b'
, 'Please describe this image.'
, _images=> array[pg_read_binary_file('/pgai/tests/postgresql-vs-pinecone.jpg')]
, _system=>'you are a helpful assistant'
, _options=> jsonb_build_object
  ( 'seed', 42
  , 'temperature', 0.9
  )
)->>'response'
;
```
