# Changelog

All the latest features and updates to Timescale products.

## üßô Compression Wizard
<Label type="date">June 13, 2024</Label>

The compression wizard is now available on Timescale Cloud. Select a hypertable and be guided through enabling compression through the UI!

To access the compression wizard, navigate to `Explorer`, and select the hypertable you would like to compress. In the top right corner, hover where it says `Compression off`, and open the wizard. You will then be guided through the process of configuring compression for your hypertable, and can compress it directly through the UI.

![Run the compression wizard in Timescale Console](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/compress-data-in-console.png)

## üèéÔ∏èüí® High Performance AI Apps With pgvectorscale

<Label type="date">June 11, 2024</Label>

The [vectorscale extension][pgvectorscale] is now available on [Timescale Cloud][signup].

pgvectorscale complements pgvector, the open-source vector data extension for PostgreSQL, and introduces the
following key innovations for pgvector data:

- A new index type called StreamingDiskANN, inspired by the DiskANN algorithm, based on research from Microsoft.
- Statistical Binary Quantization: developed by Timescale researchers, This compression method improves on
  standard Binary Quantization.

On benchmark dataset of 50 million Cohere embeddings (768 dimensions each), PostgreSQL with pgvector and
pgvectorscale achieves 28x lower p95 latency and 16x higher query throughput compared to Pinecone's storage
optimized (s1) index for approximate nearest neighbor queries at 99% recall, all at 75% less cost when
self-hosted on AWS EC2.

See the [pgvectorscale documentation][pgvectorscale] to learn more.

## üßê Integrate AI Into Your Database Using pgai

<Label type="date">June 11, 2024</Label>

The [pgai extension][pgai] is now available on [Timescale Cloud][signup].

pgai brings embedding and generation AI models closer to the database. With pgai, you can now do the following directly
from within PostgreSQL in a SQL query:

* Create embeddings for your data.
* Retrieve LLM chat completions from models like OpenAI GPT4o.
* Reason over your data and facilitate use cases like classification, summarization, and data enrichment on your existing relational data in PostgreSQL.

See the [pgai documentation][pgai] to learn more.


## TimescaleDB 2.15.2
<Label type="date">June 7, 2024</Label>

This release contains bug fixes introduced since TimescaleDB v2.15.1.
Best practice is to upgrade at the next available opportunity.

- [#6975](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/issues/6975): Fix sort pushdown for partially compressed chunks.
- [#6976](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/issues/6976): Fix removal of the metadata function and the update script.
- [#6978](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/issues/6978): Fix segfault in compress_chunk with primary space partition.
- [#6993](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/issues/6993): Disallow hash partitioning on the primary column.

## üîç Database Audit Logging with pgaudit
<Label type="date">May 27, 2024</Label>

The [PostgreSQL Audit extension(pgaudit)](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/) is now available on [Timescale Cloud][signup].
pgaudit provides detailed database session and object audit logging in the Timescale
Cloud logs.

If you have strict security and compliance requirements and need to log all operations
on the database level, pgaudit can help. You can also export these audit logs to
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

See the [pgaudit documentation](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/) to learn more.

## üå° International System of Unit support with postgresql-unit
<Label type="date">May 13, 2024</Label>

The [SI Units for PostgreSQL extension(unit)](https://github.com/df7cb/postgresql-unit) provides support for the
[ISU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) in [Timescale Cloud][signup].

You can use Timescale Cloud to solve day-to-day questions. For example, to see what 50¬∞C is in ¬∞F, run the following
query in your Timescale Cloud service:

```
SELECT '50¬∞C'::unit @ '¬∞F' as temp;
  temp
--------
 122 ¬∞F
(1 row)
```

See the [postgresql-unit documentation](https://github.com/df7cb/postgresql-unit) to learn more.
