# Install TimescaleDB
TimescaleDB is an extension to PostgreSQL that allows you to more easily and
quickly work with time-series data. You can use TimescaleDB in several different
ways, depending on what you want to do with it, and what kind of data you want
to use.

The simplest way to get started with TimescaleDB is to sign up for a free thirty
day trial on our [Timescale Cloud][tsc-install] service. This is a hosted
service that helps you to get started with TimescaleDB fast. It includes free
tutorials and sample data for you to play with if you're trying to work out
what it's all about, but it's also great for serious workloads when you're ready
to jump in.

If you want to run TimescaleDB on your own server hardware, you can also do
that! Follow the [installation instructions][self-hosted-install] in this
section for your hardware, or install from source. You can also use a
[pre-built container][self-hosted-container], or
[cloud image][self-hosted-cloud] for self-hosted TimescaleDB.

If you would prefer a managed cloud service for your TimescaleDB installation,
head over to [Managed Service for TimescaleDB][mst-install]. This option allows
you more flexibility in choosing where your installation is hosted, from more
than 75 regions on Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
