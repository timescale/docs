You can upgrade your on-premise TimescaleDB installation in-place. This means
that you do not need to dump and restore your data. However, it is still
important that you plan for your upgrade ahead of time.

Before you upgrade:

* Read [the release notes][relnotes] for the TimescaleDB version you are
  upgrading to.
* Check which PostgreSQL version you are currently running. You might need to
  [upgrade to the latest PostgreSQL version][upgrade-pg]
  before you begin your TimescaleDB upgrade.
* [Perform a backup][backup] of your database. While TimescaleDB
  upgrades are performed in-place, upgrading is an intrusive operation. Always
  make sure you have a backup on hand, and that the backup is readable in the
  case of disaster.
