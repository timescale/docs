<Procedure>

1.  Install Homebrew, if you don't already have it:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    For more information about Homebrew, including installation instructions,
    see the [Homebrew documentation][homebrew].
1.  At the command prompt, add the TimescaleDB Homebrew tap:

    ```bash
    brew tap timescale/tap
    ```

1.  Install TimescaleDB and psql:

    ```bash
    brew install timescaledb libpq
    ```

1.  Update your path to include psql.

    ```bash
    brew link --force libpq
    ```

    On Intel chips, the symbolic link is added to `/usr/local/bin`. On Apple
    Silicon, the symbolic link is added to `/opt/homebrew/bin`.

1.  Run the `timescaledb-tune` script to configure your database:

   ```bash
   timescaledb-tune --quiet --yes
   ```

1.  Change to the directory where the setup script is located. It is typically,
   located at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/timescaledb/<VERSION>/bin/`, where
   `<VERSION>` is the version of `timescaledb` that you installed:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/homebrew/Cellar/timescaledb/<VERSION>/bin/
   ```

1.  Run the setup script to complete installation.

    ```bash
    ./timescaledb_move.sh
    ```

1.  **Login to PostgreSQL as `postgres`**

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
    You are in the psql shell.

1. **Set the password for `postgres`**

    ```bash
    \password postgres
    ```

    When you have set the password, type `\q` to exit psql.
