Timescale charges are based on how much storage you use. You don't pay for a 
fixed storage size, and you don't need to worry about scaling disk size as your 
data grows; We handle it all for you. To reduce your data costs further, 
use [compression][compression], a [data retention policy][data-retention], and
[tiered storage][data-tiering].
