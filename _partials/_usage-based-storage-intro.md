Timescale charges based on how much storage you use, so you don't need to choose
and pay for a fixed storage size when you create a new service. This means that
you also don't need to worry about scaling your disk size as your data grows.
You are only charged for the storage space that you actually use. Make sure you use
[compression][compression], a [data retention policy][data-retention], and
[data tiering][data-tiering], to help you manage costs.
