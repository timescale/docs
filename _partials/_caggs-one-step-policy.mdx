<h2>
  Use a one-step policy definition to set a {props.policyType} policy on a
  continuous aggregate
</h2>

In TimescaleDB 2.8 and above, policy management on continuous aggregates is
simplified. You can add, change, or remove the refresh, compression, and data
retention policies on a continuous aggregate using a one-step API. For more
information, see the APIs for [adding policies][add-policies], [altering
policies][alter-policies], and [removing policies][remove-policies]. Note that
this feature is experimental.

<Experimental />

<highlight type="note">
  When you change policies with this API, the changes apply to the continuous
  aggregate, not to the original hypertable. For example, if you use this API to
  set a retention policy of 20 days, chunks older than 20 days are dropped from
  the continuous aggregate. The retention policy of the original hypertable
  remains unchanged.
