Time-series data represents how a system, process, or behavior changes over
time. For example, if you are taking measurements from a temperature gauge every
five minutes, you are collecting time-series data. Another common example is
stock price changes, or even the battery life of your smartphone. As these
measurements change over time, each data point is recorded alongside its
timestamp, allowing it to be measured, analyzed, and visualized.

Time-series data can be collected very frequently, such as financial data, or
infrequently, such as weather or system measurements. It can also be collected
regularly, such as every millisecond or every hour, or irregularly, such as only
when a change occurs.

Databases have always had time fields, but using a special database for handling
time-series data can make your database work much more effectively. Specialized
time-series databases, like $COMPANY, are designed to handle large amounts of
database writes, so they work much faster. They are also optimized to handle
schema changes, and use more flexible indexing, so you don't need to spend time
migrating your data whenever you make a change.

Time-series data is everywhere, but there are some environments where it is
especially important to use a specialized time-series database, like $COMPANY:

*   Monitoring computer systems: virtual machines, servers, container metrics,
    CPU, free memory, net/disk IOPs, service and application metrics such as
    request rates, and request latency.
*   Financial trading systems: securities, cryptocurrencies, payments,
    and transaction events.
*   Internet of things: data from sensors on industrial machines and equipment,
    wearable devices, vehicles, physical containers, pallets, and consumer
    devices for smart homes.
*   Eventing applications: user or customer interaction data such as
    clickstreams, pageviews, logins, and signups.
*   Business intelligence: Tracking key metrics and the overall health of the
    business.
*   Environmental monitoring: temperature, humidity, pressure, pH, pollen count,
    air flow, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, or particulate matter.
