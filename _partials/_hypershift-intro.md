You can use hypershift to migrate existing PostgreSQL databases in one step, and
enable compression and hypertable creation on the fly.

Hypershift can migrate your data in Timescale Cloud from these sources:

*   Standard PostgreSQL databases
*   Amazon RDS databases
*   Other Timescale databases, including Managed Service for TimescaleDB, and
    self-hosted TimescaleDB

Because compression is enabled during the migration, you do not need to have the
maximum amount of storage available in the target database before you start
migration.
