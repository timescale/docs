Timescale is the database platform built for developers. It's engineered to
deliver speed and scale for your resource-intensive workloads&mdash;like those using
time series, event, and analytics data.

*   _PostgreSQL++_ - Timescale is the PostgreSQL you know and love, giving you
    access to the entire PostgreSQL ecosystem, but Timescale has additional
    features like hypertables, compression and continuous aggregates.
*   _Faster query performance_ - Timescale dramatically improves your
    performance with automatic partitioning using Timescale hypertables and
    automatically refreshed materialized views with Timescale continuous
    aggregates.
*   _Lower costs as you scale_ - Timescale's straightforward and predictable
    pricing is based on two metrics, compute and storage. You only pay for what
    you use, and Timescale can save you even more money with features like
    native compression and data tiering to S3.
*   _Worry-free_ - Timescale simplifies deployment and management with a
    user-friendly interface, along with one-click replicas, forks, monitoring,
    high availability, connection pooling, and more. And our expert support team
    is available to assist you at no extra charge.
