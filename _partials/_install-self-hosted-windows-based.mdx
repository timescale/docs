<Procedure>


1. **Install the latest version of PostgreSQL and psql**

    1. Download [PostgreSQL][pg-download], then run the installer.

        1. In the `Select Components` dialog, check `Command Line Tools`, along with any other components
           you want to install, and click `Next`.

        1. Complete the installation wizard.

            If you see an error like `could not load library "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/14/lib/timescaledb-2.16.1.dll": The specified module could not be found.`, use 
            [Dependencies][dependencies] to ensure that your system can find the compatible DLLs for this release of TimescaleDB. 

    1. Check that you can run `pg_config`.
        If you cannot run `pg_config` from the command line, in the Windows
        Search tool, enter `system environment variables`.
        The path should be `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin`.

1.  **Install TimescaleDB**

    1.  Unzip the [TimescaleDB installer](#supported-platforms) to <install_dir>.

        Best practice is to use the latest version.

    1.  In <install_dir>, right-click `setup.exe`, then choose `Run as Administrator`.

    1. Complete the installation wizard.

1.  **Tune your PostgreSQL instance for TimescaleDB**

     Run the `timescaledb-tune` script included in the `timescaledb-tools` package with TimescaleDB. For more
            information, see [configuration][config].

1.  **Login to PostgreSQL as `postgres`**

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
    You are in the psql shell.

1. **Set the password for `postgres`**

    ```bash
    \password postgres
    ```

    When you have set the password, type `\q` to exit psql.
