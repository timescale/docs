## Add Timescale as a data source in Grafana

You can use Grafana to visualize queries directly from your Timescale database.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

*   Created a [Timescale Cloud][cloud-login] service.
*   Installed a self-managed Grafana account, or signed up for
    [Grafana Cloud][install-grafana].
*   Found the connection details for the database you want to use as a data
    source. The details are contained in the cheatsheet you downloaded when you
    created the service.
