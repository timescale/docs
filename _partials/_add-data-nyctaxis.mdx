## Load trip data

When you have your database set up, you can load the taxi trip data into the
`rides` hypertable.

<procedure>

### Loading trip data

<highlight type="important">
This is a large dataset, so it might take a long time, depending on your network
connection.
</highlight>

1.  Download the dataset:

   <tag type="download">
   [nyc_data.tar.gz](https://timescaledata.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/nyc_data.tar.gz)
   </tag>

1.  Use your file manager to decompress the downloaded dataset, and take a note
    of the path to the `nyc_data_rides.csv` file.

1.  At the psql prompt, copy the data from the `nyc_data_rides.csv` file into
    your hypertable. Make sure you point to the correct path, if it is not in
    your current working directory:

    ```sql
    \COPY rides FROM nyc_data_rides.csv CSV;
    ```

</procedure>

You can check that the data has been copied successfully with this command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM rides LIMIT 5;
```

You should get five records that look like this:

```sql
