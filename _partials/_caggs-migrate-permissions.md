You might get a permissions error when migrating a continuous aggregate from old
to new format using `cagg_migrate`. The user performing the migration must have
the following permissions:

*   Select, insert, and update permissions on the tables
    `_timescale_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan` and
    `_timescale_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan_step`
*   Usage permissions on the sequence
    `_timescaledb_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan_step_step_id_seq`

To solve the problem, change to a user capable of granting permissions, and
grant the following permissions to the user performing the migration:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLE _timescaledb_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan TO <USER>;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLE _timescaledb_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan_step TO <USER>;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE _timescaledb_catalog.continuous_agg_migrate_plan_step_step_id_seq TO <USER>;
```
