Timescale is a cloud based PostgreSQL platform for demanding workloads. We help you you build faster, scale further, and stay under budget. Timescale offers the following PostgreSQL database optimisations:

- [**Time-series data**](https://www.timescale.com/blog/what-is-a-time-series-database/#what-is-a-time-series-database): a
  TimescaleDB instance optimized for your time-series and analytics workloads. Get automated dynamic data partitioning, hybrid row-columnar storage, advanced compression techniques, incremental up-to-date materializations, and specialized analysis functions as well as cloud-only features like transparent tiering to low-cost object storage.

- **All other workloads**: a [Dynamic PostgreSQL](https://www.timescale.com/dynamic-postgresql) instance where you select a compute range, only paying for the base and the amount of extra CPU as you scale.

All databases are extended with lightning fast vector search, and include all the cloud tooling you'd expect for production use,
with automatic backups, high availability, read replicas, data forking, connection pooling, usage-based storage and much more.
