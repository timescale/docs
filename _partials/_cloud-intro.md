Timescale Cloud is a cloud-based PostgreSQL platform for resource-intensive workloads. We help you build faster, 
scale further, and stay under budget. Timescale Cloud offers the following PostgreSQL optimized database services:

- **[Time-series][create-service]**: a Timescale DB instance optimized for your
  [time-series and analytics][what-is-time-series] workloads. Get automated dynamic data partitioning, hybrid 
  row-columnar storage, advanced compression techniques, incremental up-to-date materializations, and specialized 
  analysis functions as well as cloud-only features like transparent tiering and low-cost object storage.
- **[General-purpose PostgreSQL][create-service]**: for all other workloads. A PostgreSQL instance with a
  [dynamic compute range][what-is-dynamic-postgres] aligned to your business needs. You select a compute range, only 
  paying for the base and the amount of extra CPU as you scale.

All databases are extended with lightning fast vector search, and include all the cloud tooling you'd expect for production use,
with automatic backups, high availability, read replicas, data forking, connection pooling, usage-based storage, and much more.
