Now that you have an active Timescale account, you create and manage your services in Timescale Console:

1. In the [service creation page][create-service], choose **Time Series and Analytics**.
   ![Create Timescale Cloud service](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-cloud-service-capabilities.png)

1. In **Create a service**, configure your service, then click **Create service**.

   Your service is constructed immediately and is ready to use.

1. Click **Download the config** and store the configuration information you need to connect to this service in a
   secure location.

   This file contains the passwords and configuration information you need to connect to your service using the
   Timescale Console Cloud SQL editors, from the command line, or using third party database administration tools.

1. Follow the service creation wizard.

If you choose to go directly to the service overview, [Check your service and connect to it][connect-to-your-service]
shows you how to connect.
