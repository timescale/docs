  If your workload lives in the AWS major regions, we recommend using [Timescale
  Cloud](/cloud/latest/). This platform is built and exclusively operated by
  Timescale, designed to offer maximum cost-effectiveness and performance for
  time-series data. If you need Azure, GCP, or a specific AWS region not
  available in Timescale Cloud, [Managed Service for TimescaleDB](/mst/latest/)
  is the best choice for you.
