On Timescale Cloud and Managed Service for TimescaleDB, restart background
workers by doing one of the following:

*   Run `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore()`, followed by `SELECT
    timescaledb_post_restore()`.
*   Power the service off and on again. This might cause a downtime of a few
    minutes while the service restores from backup and replays the write-ahead
    log.
