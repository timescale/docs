Real-time aggregates automatically add the most recent data when you query your
continuous aggregate. In other words, they include data _more recent than_ your
last materialized bucket.

If you add new _historical_ data to an already-materialized bucket, it won't be
reflected in a real-time aggregate. You should wait for the next scheduled
refresh, or manually refresh by calling `refresh_continuous_aggregate`. You can
think of real-time aggregates as being eventually consistent for historical
data.
