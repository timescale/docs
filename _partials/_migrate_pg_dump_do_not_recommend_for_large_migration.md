We do not recommend using this migration method to migrate more than
100&nbsp;GB of data, primarily because of the amount of downtime that it
implies for your application, instead use the [live migration]
low-downtime migration solution. Should you nonetheless wish to migrate more
than 400&nbsp;GB of data with this method, open a support request to ensure
that enough disk is pre-provisioned on your Timescale instance.
