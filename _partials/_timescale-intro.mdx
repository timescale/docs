TimescaleDB expands PostgreSQL for time-series data. Leveraging PostgreSQL
rock-solid foundations, it gives it the extra performance, scalability, and
usability required to handle relentless streams of time-series data. TimescaleDB
is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension. If you're self-hosting your own
PostgreSQL instance, TimescaleDB can be added to it completely for free.
