To serve TimescaleDB deployments in Azure, GCP, and certain regions in AWS,
we've partnered with the vendor Aiven to offer Managed Service for TimescaleDB.
This is a managed database platform through which you'll be able to deploy
TimescaleDB instances with ease, automating operational tasks like scaling,
resizing, configuring high availability, and much more.
