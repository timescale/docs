For the sake of convenience, connection strings to the source and target
databases are referred to as `$SOURCE` and `$TARGET` throughout this guide.
This can be set in your shell, for example:

```bash
export SOURCE=postgres://<user>@<source host>:<source port>/<dbname>
export TARGET=postgres://<user>@<target host>:<target port>/<dbname>
```
