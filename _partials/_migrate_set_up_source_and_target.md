For the sake of convenience, we refer to connection strings to the source and
target databases as `$SOURCE` and `$TARGET` throughout this guide. This can be
set in your shell, for example:

```bash
export SOURCE=postgres://<user>@<source host>:<source port>
export TARGET=postgres://<user>@<target host>:<target port>
```
