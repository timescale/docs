For the sake of convenience, connection strings to the source and target
databases are referred to as `$SOURCE` and `$TARGET` throughout this guide.
  
This can be set in your shell, for example:

```bash
export SOURCE=postgres://<user>:<password>@<source host>:<source port>/<db_name>
export TARGET=postgres://<user>:<password>@<target host>:<target port>/<db_name>
```
