When you have set up your integration, you can check that it is working
correctly by looking for the metrics that Timescale Cloud exports. The metric
names are:

- `timescale.cloud.system.cpu.usage.millicores`
- `timescale.cloud.system.cpu.total.millicores`
- `timescale.cloud.system.memory.usage.bytes`
- `timescale.cloud.system.memory.total.bytes`
- `timescale.cloud.system.disk.usage.bytes`
- `timescale.cloud.system.disk.total.bytes`

Additionally, Timescale Cloud exports tags that you can use to filter your results. You can also check that these tags are being correctly exported:

- `host = <timescale-region>.timescale-cloud`
- `project-id`
- `service-id`
- `region` (The Timescale Cloud region)
- `role = replica` or `role = primary` (for services with replicas)
- `node-id` (for multi-node services)
