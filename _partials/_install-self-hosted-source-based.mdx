<Procedure>

1. **Install the latest PostgreSQL source**

    1.  At the command prompt, clone the TimescaleDB GitHub repository:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb
        ```

    1.  Change into the cloned directory:

        ```bash
        cd timescaledb
        ```

    1.  Checkout the latest release. You can find the latest release tag on
        our [Releases page][gh-releases]:

        ```bash
        git checkout 2.15.1
        ```

        This command produces an error that you are now in `detached head` state. It
        is expected behavior, and it occurs because you have checked out a tag, and
        not a branch. Continue with the steps in this procedure as normal.

1.  **Build the source**

    1.  Bootstrap the build system:

        <Terminal>

        <tab label='Linux'>

        ```bash
        ./bootstrap
        ```

        </tab>

        <tab label="Windows">

        ```powershell
        bootstrap.bat
        ```

        </tab>

        </Terminal>

        For installation on Microsoft Windows, you might need to add the `pg_config`
        and `cmake` file locations to your path. In the Windows Search tool, search
        for `system environment variables`. The path for `pg_config` should be
        `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin`. The path for `cmake` is within
        the Visual Studio directory.

    1.  Build the extension:

        <Terminal>

        <tab label='Linux'>

        ```bash
        cd build && make
        ```

        </tab>

        <tab label="Windows">

        ```powershell
        cmake --build ./build --config Release
        ```

        </tab>

        </Terminal>

1.  **Install TimescaleDB**

    <Terminal>

    <tab label='Linux'>

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

    </tab>

    <tab label="Windows">

    ```powershell
    cmake --build ./build --config Release --target install
    ```

    </tab>

    </Terminal>

1. **Configure PostgreSQL**

    If you have more than one version of PostgreSQL installed, TimescaleDB can only
    be associated with one of them. The TimescaleDB build scripts use `pg_config` to
    find out where PostgreSQL stores its extension files, so you can use `pg_config`
    to find out which PostgreSQL installation TimescaleDB is using.

    1.  Locate the `postgresql.conf` configuration file:

        ```bash
        psql -d postgres -c "SHOW config_file;"
        ```

    1.  Open the `postgresql.conf` file and update `shared_preload_libraries` to:

        ```bash
        shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'
        ```

        If you use other preloaded libraries, make sure they are comma separated.

    1.  Tune your PostgreSQL instance for TimescaleDB

        ```bash
        sudo timescaledb-tune
        ```

        This script is included with the `timescaledb-tools` package when you install TimescaleDB.
        For more information, see [configuration][config].

    1.  Restart the PostgreSQL instance:

        <Terminal>

        <tab label='Linux'>

        ```bash
        service postgresql restart
        ```

        </tab>

        <tab label="Windows">

        ```powershell
        pg_ctl restart
        ```

        </tab>

        </Terminal>

1. **Set the user password**

    1.  Login to PostgreSQL as `postgres`

        ```bash
        sudo -u postgres psql
        ```
        You are in the psql shell.

    1. Set the password for `postgres`

        ```bash
        \password postgres
        ```

        When you have set the password, type `\q` to exit psql.
