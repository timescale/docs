The financial sector regularly uses [candlestick charts][charts] to visualize
the price change of an asset. Each candlestick represents a time period, such as
one minute or one hour, and shows how the asset's price changed during that time.

Candlestick charts are generated from the open, high, low, close, and volume
data for each financial asset during the time period. This is often abbreviated
as OHLCV:

*   Open: opening price
*   High: highest price
*   Low: lowest price
*   Close: closing price
*   Volume: volume of transactions
