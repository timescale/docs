# Welcome to the TimescaleDB documentation!

[test][test]

TimescaleDB is a time-series database, built on top of PostgreSQL. More than that,
however, it's a relational database for time-series. Developers who use TimescaleDB
get the benefit of a purpose-built time-series database, plus a classic relational
database (PostgreSQL), all in one, with full SQL support.

In this section of our documentation, we present all of the information you need
to understand what TimescaleDB is, how it works, how to get started, and how
to successfully use and implement all of the powerful features for your next
project.

### Testing

### Overview

In the **[Overview section][overview]** you'll find everything you need to know about the design
and core concepts that make TimescaleDB the super powered, time-series database
that it is.

You'll also find [Release Notes][release-notes], our [FAQ][faq], and any [known limitations][limitations] with the
current version of TimescaleDB that you should be aware of.

### Getting started

The **[Getting started tutorial][getting-started]** leads you through your first experience with
TimescaleDB by setting up hypertables, importing data, running queries, and
exploring the key features that make TimescaleDB a pleasure to use.

If you've never used TimescaleDB or haven't explored many of our features yet,
this is the place to start.

### How-to guides

Our **[How-to guides][how-to]** provide answers to common questions with each feature
of TimescaleDB. Using hypertables, enabling native compression, setting up data retention,
and much more are all covered here.

### Tutorials

**[TimescaleDB tutorials][tutorials]** is an ever-growing list of new long-form guides
to help you setup a project from beginning to end in order to explore features of
TimescaleDB in more depth.

The current list includes examples on [time-series forecasting][forecast], [using Prometheus
and Promscale][promscale], a ðŸ’¯ series of [Grafana examples][grafana], [analyzing cryptocurrency][crypto],
and more.

### Code quick starts

In our **[Code quick starts][code]** section we provide samples of connecting to
TimescaleDB from a growing list of application languages using standard SDKs
and best practices.
