# Set up TimescaleDB and Grafana

This tutorial uses Managed Service for TimescaleDB (MST) to set up your database, and
to set up Grafana. You can [create a free account][mst-login] to try it out.

## Create a new service for Grafana

You need to sign in to your MST account to create a
new service to run Grafana.

<Procedure>

### Creating a new service for Grafana

1.  [Log in to your Managed Service for TimescaleDB account][mst-login]. By default, you start in the
    `Services` view, showing any services you currently have in your project.
1.  Click `Create a new service`.
1.  In the `Select your service` section, click `TimescaleDB Grafana - Metrics
    dashboard`:

1.  In the `Select your cloud service provider` and `Select your cloud service
    region` sections, choose the provider and region that you prefer, or accept
    the default values.
1.  In the `Select your service plan` section, click `Dashboard-1`.
1.  In the `Provide your service name` section, type a name for your new
    service. In this example, we've used `grafana-tutorial`.

1.  When you are happy with your selections, click `Create Service` to go back
    to the `Services` view while your service is created. The status indicator
    says `Rebuilding` while the service is created. It is ready for you to use
    when the indicator is green and says `Running`. This usually takes a couple
    of minutes, but different clouds can vary. You can click the service name in
    the list to see more information and make changes.

When your service is built, you can log and set up your data services.

### Logging in to your MST Grafana service

1.  In the [MST account][mst-login] `Services` view, click the name of your new
    Grafana service.
1.  On the service details page, take a note of the user name and password for
    your service, and click the link in the `Service URI` field to open Grafana:

I appreciate that this doesn't really fit here well at the moment, but I'm coming back to this tutorial next, and will rewrite it properly then. I promise! --LKB 2023-02-28
