### Introduction [](introduction)
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a trend where computing is 
becoming ubiquitous and is embedded in more and more physical things. 
For many of these things, the purpose of IoT is to collect sensor data 
about the environment in which it exists: e.g., oil wells, factories, 
power plants, farms, moving vehicles, office buildings, homes.

In other words, IoT is all about the data. And the datasets generated by 
these things are generally time-series in nature, with relational 
metadata to describe those things.

Often, it is necessary to simulate IoT sensor data, for example, when
testing a new system. In this tutorial, we show how to simulate a 
basic IoT sensor dataset on PostgreSQL, or TimescaleDB.

*Note: For creating a more advanced simulated IoT dataset, please
try the Time-series Benchmarking Suite (TSBS) ([Github][github-tsbs]).*

### Prerequisites [](prereqs)

To complete this tutorial, you will need a cursory knowledge of the Structured Query 
Language (SQL). The tutorial will walk you through each SQL command, but it will be 
helpful if you've seen SQL before.

To start, [install TimescaleDB][install-timescale]. Once your installation is complete, 
we can proceed to ingesting or creating sample data and finishing the tutorial.


### Step 1 - Set up your tables [](step1)
First, connect to your database via `psql`.

Second, create the “sensors” and “sensor_data” tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  location VARCHAR(50)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  sensor_id INTEGER,
  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
  cpu DOUBLE PRECISION,
  FOREIGN KEY (sensor_id) REFERENCES sensors (id)
);
```

Third (only if you are using TimescaleDB), convert the `sensor_data`
table into a [`hypertable`][docs-hypertable]:

```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', 'time');
```

Fourth, populate the sensors table with 4 sensors:

```sql
INSERT INTO sensors (type, location) VALUES
('a','floor'),
('a', 'ceiling'),
('b','floor'),
('b', 'ceiling');
```

Fifth, verify that the sensors were created correctly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sensors;
```

After running that last SQL statement, you should see something like
this:

```
 id | type | location 
----+------+----------
  1 | a    | floor
  2 | a    | ceiling
  3 | b    | floor
  4 | b    | ceiling
(4 rows)
```

### Step 2 - Create the simulated IoT sensor data [](step2)

*Note: for the following sections we’ll share the results of our queries
as an example, but since the tutorial generates random data every time
it is run, your results will look different (but will be structured the
same way).*

First, generate a dataset for all of our four sensors and insert into
our sensor_data table:

```sql
INSERT INTO sensor_data (time, sensor_id, cpu, temperature)
SELECT
  time,
  sensor_id,
  random() AS cpu,
  random()*100 AS temperature
FROM generate_series(now() - interval '24 hour', now(), interval '5 minute') AS g1(time), generate_series(1,4,1) AS g2(sensor_id);
```

Second, verify that the simulated sensor data was written correctly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sensor_data ORDER BY time;
```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

```
             time              | sensor_id |    temperature     |         cpu         
-------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+---------------------
 2020-03-31 15:56:25.843575+00 |         1 |   6.86688972637057 |   0.682070567272604
 2020-03-31 15:56:40.244287+00 |         2 |    26.589260622859 |   0.229583469685167

 2020-03-31 15:56:53.560205+00 |         4 |   24.3201029952615 |   0.641885648947209

...
```

Congrats! We've created a basic IoT sensor dataset. Now let's run some 
queries.

### Step 3 - Run basic queries (optional) [](step3)

*Note: This section requires TimescaleDB*

#### Average temperature, average cpu by 30 minute windows:
```sql
SELECT 
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period, 
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp, 
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu 
FROM sensor_data 
GROUP BY period;
```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
         period         |     avg_temp     |      avg_cpu      
------------------------+------------------+-------------------
 2020-03-31 19:00:00+00 | 49.6615830013373 | 0.477344429974134
 2020-03-31 22:00:00+00 | 58.8521540844037 | 0.503637770501276
 2020-03-31 16:00:00+00 | 50.4250325243144 | 0.511075591299838
 2020-03-31 17:30:00+00 | 49.0742547437549 | 0.527267253802468
 2020-04-01 14:30:00+00 | 49.3416377226822 | 0.438027751864865
 ...
```

#### Average & last temperature, average cpu by 30 minute windows:
But what if we don’t just want the average temperature for each period,
but also the last temperature? (For example if we wanted to understand
the final temperature value at the end of the interval.)

```sql
SELECT 
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period, 
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp, 
  last(temperature, time) AS last_temp, 
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu 
FROM sensor_data 
GROUP BY period;
```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
         period         |     avg_temp     |    last_temp     |      avg_cpu      
------------------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------
 2020-03-31 19:00:00+00 | 49.6615830013373 | 84.3963081017137 | 0.477344429974134
 2020-03-31 22:00:00+00 | 58.8521540844037 | 76.5528806950897 | 0.503637770501276
 2020-03-31 16:00:00+00 | 50.4250325243144 | 43.5192013625056 | 0.511075591299838
 2020-03-31 17:30:00+00 | 49.0742547437549 |  22.740753274411 | 0.527267253802468
 2020-04-01 14:30:00+00 | 49.3416377226822 | 59.1331578791142 | 0.438027751864865
...
```

#### Using the sensor metadata
Now let’s take advantage of some of the metadata we have stored in the
`sensors` table:

```sql
SELECT 
  sensors.location,
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period, 
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp, 
  last(temperature, time) AS last_temp, 
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu 
FROM sensor_data JOIN sensors on sensor_data.sensor_id = sensors.id
GROUP BY period, sensors.location;
```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
 location |         period         |     avg_temp     |     last_temp     |      avg_cpu      
----------+------------------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------
