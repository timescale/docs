# Store financial tick data in TimescaleDB using the OHLCV (candlestick) format
[Candlestick charts][charts] are the standard way to analyze the price changes of
financial assets. They can be used to examine trends in stock prices, cryptocurrency prices, 
or even NFT prices. To generate candlestick charts, you need candlestick data in
the OHLCV format. That is, you need the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data for
some financial assets.

This tutorial shows you how to efficiently store raw financial tick
data, create different candlestick views, and query aggregated data in
TimescaleDB using the OHLCV format. It also shows you how to download sample
data containing real-world crypto tick transactions for cryptocurrencies like
BTC, ETH, and other popular assets.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
* A TimescaleDB instance running locally or on the cloud. For more information, see [installation options](/install/latest/)
* [`psql`][psql], DBeaver, or any other PostgreSQL client

## What's candlestick data and OHLCV?
Candlestick charts are used in the financial sector to visualize the price
change of an asset. Each candlestick represents a time
frame (for example, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, or similar) and shows how the asset's
price changed during that time.

Candlestick charts are generated from candlestick data, which is the collection of data points
used in the chart. This is often abbreviated
as OHLCV (open-high-low-close-volume):

* Open: opening price
* High: highest price 
* Low: lowest price 
* Close: closing price
* Volume: volume of transactions

These data points correspond to the bucket of time covered by the candlestick.
For example, a 1-minute candlestick would need the open and close prices for that minute.
