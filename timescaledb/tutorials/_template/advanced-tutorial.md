# Advanced steps
Use this section to provide additional or extra things that readers can try with
the dataset to further their understanding of the underlying topic.

## The first advanced step
This should be the simplest of the advanced steps. Start by explaining which
question the query answers. Then explain how the query is constructed, then
provide the query in a code block.

Provide example results of the query, using either a code block or, if more
appropriate, an image.

## The second advanced step
Continue to build on the first query you presented, providing more information,
explaining the query, and continuing to explain which questions are being
answered. Repeat as required.

Include any reference-style links at the bottom of the page.
