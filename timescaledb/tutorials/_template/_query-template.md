# Query the data
Use this section to talk about the queries that readers can do on the dataset.
Make sure you reference which questions are being answered by the queries.

## The first query
This should be the simplest query. Start by explaining which question the query
answers. Then explain how the query is constructed, then provide the query in a
code block.

Provide example results of the query, using either a code block or, if more
appropriate, an image.

## The second query
Continue to build on the first query you presented, providing more information,
explaining the query, and continuing to explain which questions are being
answered. Repeat as required.

Include any reference-style links at the bottom of the page.
