# Using Tableau to visualize data in TimescaleDB

[Tableau][get-tableau] is a popular analytics platform that enables you to gain
greater intelligence about your business. It is an ideal tool for visualizing
data stored in [TimescaleDB][timescale-products].

In this tutorial, we will cover:

- Setting up Tableau to work with TimescaleDB
- Running queries on TimescaleDB from within Tableau
- Visualize data in Tableau

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need a cursory knowledge of the Structured Query
Language (SQL). The tutorial will walk you through each SQL command, but it will be
helpful if you've seen SQL before.

To start, [install TimescaleDB][install-timescale]. Once your installation is complete,
we can proceed to ingesting or creating sample data and finishing the tutorial.

Also, [get a copy or license of Tableau][get-tableau].

You will also want to [complete the Cryptocurrency tutorial][crypto-tutorial], as it will
setup and configure the data you need to complete the remainder of this
tutorial. We will visualize many of the queries found at the end of the Cryptocurrency
tutorial.

### Step 1: Setup Tableau to connect to TimescaleDB

Locate the `host`, `port`, and `password` of your TimescaleDB instance.

Connecting your TimescaleDB instance to Tableau takes just a few clicks, thanks
to Tableau's  built-in Postgres connector. To connect to your database add a new
connection and under the  ‘to a server' section, select PostgreSQL as the
connection type. Then enter your database  credentials.

### Step 2: Run a simple query in Tableau

Let's use the built-in SQL editor in Tableau. To run a query, add custom SQL to your data source
by dragging and dropping the “New Custom SQL” button (in the bottom left of the Tableau desktop
user interface) to the place that says ‘Drag tables here'.

A window will pop up, in which we can place a query. In this case, we will use the first
query from the [Cryptocurrency Tutorial][crypto-tutorial]:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('7 days', time) AS period,
      last(closing_price, time) AS last_closing_price
FROM btc_prices
WHERE currency_code = 'USD'
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period
```

You should see the same results in Tableau that you see when you run the query in the
`psql` command line.

Let's also name our data source 'btc_7_days', which you can see below.

### Step 3: Visualize data in Tableau

Results in a table are only so useful, graphs are much better! So in our final
step, let's take our output from the previous step and turn it into an interactive
graph in Tableau.

To do this, create a new worksheet (or dashboard) and then select your desired data source
(in our case ‘btc_7_days'), as shown below.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-tableau-tutorial/tableau-new-worksheet.png" alt="New worksheet in Tableau to examine time-series data"/>

In the far left pane, you'll see a section Tableau calls 'Dimensions' and 'Measures'.
Whenever you use Tableau, it will classify your fields as either dimensions or
measures. A measure is a field that is a dependent variable, meaning its value is a
function of one or more dimensions. For example, the price of an item on a given day
is a measure based on which day is in question. A dimension, therefore, is an
independent variable. In our example, the given day does not change based on
any other value in our database.

To put it in more direct terms, July 4, 1776 is still July 4, 1776, even if the
price of tea skyrockets. However, the price of tea may change, depending on which
day we are looking into.

So, in our case, we want to move the dimension `period` into the Columns section of
our worksheet, while we want to examine the measure `last_closing_price` depending
on a given `period`. In Tableau, we can drag and drop these elements into the
proper place, like so:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-tableau-tutorial/tableau-dimension-measure-setup.png" alt="New dimensions and measures in Tableau to examine time-series data"/>

Now this graph doesn't quite have the level of fidelity we're looking for because
the data points are being grouped by year. To fix this, click on the drop down
arrow on period and select 'exact date'.

Tableau is a powerful business intelligence tool and an ideal companion to data
stored in TimescaleDB. We've only scratched the surface of the kinds of data
you can visualize using Tableau.
