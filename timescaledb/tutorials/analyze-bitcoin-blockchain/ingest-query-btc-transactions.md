# Insert and query Bitcoin transactions
This section of the tutorial provides an example database schema that you can
use to ingest and store Bitcoin blockchain data in TimescaleDB. The schema
consists of only one table called `transactions`.

## Bitcoin transaction data fields
Before you create the table and ingest our sample data, it's important to
understand what data fields are available in a Bitcoin transaction:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| time | Timestamp of the transaction |
| block_id | Block ID |
| hash | Hash ID of the transaction |
| size | Size of the transaction in KB |
| weight | Size of the transaction in weight units |
| is_coinbase | First transaction in a block, includes the miner's reward |
| output_total | The value of the transaction in Satoshi (sat) |
| output_total_usd | The value of the transaction in USD |
| fee | Transaction fee in Satoshi (sat) |
| fee_usd | Transaction fee in USD |


## Table definition

Run the following query to create the `transactions` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
   time TIMESTAMPTZ,
   block_id INT,
   hash TEXT,
   size INT,
   weight INT,
   is_coinbase BOOLEAN,
   output_total BIGINT,
   output_total_usd DOUBLE PRECISION,
   fee BIGINT,
   fee_usd DOUBLE PRECISION,
   details JSONB
);
```

This is a simplified schema that you can use to store Bitcoin
transactions. If you look inside
the sample data file that we provide later in this tutorial you notice that
the last column called `details` actually contains a JSON string with multiple
data points. That's why the table definition also has a JSONB `details` column.
These data points are not used in this tutorial, aside from ingesting them, but once you
are familiar with blockchain data you might get inspired to involve these data
fields as well.


Right after creating the table, turn it into a hypertable by using the
`create_hypertable()` function. This step is essential to use TimescaleDB's
underlying
chunking mechanism for performance improvements. This function needs two
parameters: the name of the table and the name of the TIMESTAMP
column. In this case, `transactions` and `time` respectively.

```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('transactions', 'time');
```

Next, let's create some additional indexes on
the hypertable to optimize the execution of some of the SQL queries you will
run in later parts of the tutorial.

## Create indexes
When you create a hypertable, TimescaleDB automatically adds a B-tree index
on the timestamp column of the table. This already improves the queries
where you filter by the time column.

Additonally, you let's speed up queries in which you're searching for
individual transactions using the `hash` column, by adding a `HASH INDEX` to
the column:
```sql
CREATE INDEX hash_idx ON public.transactions USING HASH (hash)
```

Next, speed up block-level queries by adding an index on the `block_id` column:
```sql
CREATE INDEX block_idx ON public.transactions (block_id)
```

You can also ensure that you donâ€™t accidentally insert duplicate records
by adding a `UNIQUE INDEX` on the `time` and `hash` columns.
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX time_hash_idx ON public.transactions (time, hash)
```

## Ingest Bitcoin transactions
You created the hypertable and added proper indexes.
Next, ingest some Bitcoin transactions. We provide a sample file
containing Bitcoin transactions from the past five days. This CSV file is
updated daily so you always download recent Bitcoin transactions.
Insert this dataset into your TimescaleDB instance.

<procedure>

### Ingesting Bitcoin transactions
1. Download the sample `.csv` file: <tag type="download">[bitcoin_sample.csv](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/downloads/bitcoin-blockchain/bitcoin_sample.zip)</tag>
    ```bash
    wget https://assets.timescale.com/docs/downloads/bitcoin-blockchain/bitcoin_sample.zip
    ```
1. Unzip the file and change the directory if you need to:
    ```bash
    unzip bitcoin_sample.zip
    cd bitcoin_sample
    ```
1. At the `psql` prompt, insert the content of the `.csv` file into the database.
    ```bash
    psql -x "postgres://tsdbadmin:{YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE}@{YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE}:{YOUR_PORT_HERE}/tsdb?sslmode=require"
    
    \COPY transactions FROM 'bitcoin_sample.csv' CSV HEADER;
    ```
    The process should complete in 3-5 minutes.

</procedure>

Once the ingestion finishes, your database has around 1.5M Bitcoin
transactions in it and you can start making your first queries.

## Query Bitcoin transactions
Query the five most recent non-coinbase transactions from the database:

```sql
SELECT time, hash, block_id, weight  FROM transactions 
WHERE is_coinbase IS NOT TRUE
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 5
```

The result looks something like this:

time               |hash                                                            |block_id|weight|

<highlight type="note">
A **coinbase transaction** is the first transaction in each block in which the
miner receives the transaction fees and block reward for the mining work.

Here's another example query that returns the five most recent blocks and
stats about them like block weight, transaction count, and value in USD:
```sql
WITH recent_blocks AS (
	SELECT block_id FROM transactions 
	WHERE is_coinbase IS TRUE
	ORDER BY time DESC 
	LIMIT 5
) 
SELECT
	t.block_id, count(*) AS transaction_count,
	SUM(weight) AS block_weight,
	SUM(output_total_usd) AS block_value_usd
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN recent_blocks b ON b.block_id = t.block_id
WHERE is_coinbase IS NOT TRUE
GROUP BY t.block_id
```

Result:

block_id|transaction_count|block_weight|block_value_usd   |
--------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
  738489|             2508|     3991873|402592534.37649953|
  738487|             2231|     3991983| 560811110.1410986|
  738488|             3208|     3991994| 422477674.0440979|
  738486|             2154|     3996197| 481098865.6260999|
  738485|             2602|     3991871| 761258578.3764017|

At this point, you have Bitcoin blockchain data in your database and you've made
your first SQL queries. Let's dig deeper into the blockchain and use
TimescaleDB hyperfunctions to generate insights!
