# Tutorial: Analyze Cryptocurrency Market Data

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide on how to analyze a time-series 
cryptocurrency dataset using TimescaleDB. The instructions in this tutorial 
were used to create [this analysis of 4100+ cryptocurrencies][crypto-blog].

This tutorial will cover the following four steps:

1. Design our database schema
1. Create a dataset using publicly available cryptocurrency pricing data
1. Load the dataset into TimescaleDB
1. Query the data in TimescaleDB

You can [skip ahead to the TimescaleDB portion](#timescaledbsection) if you would prefer
not to run through the scripts to create your database schema or your dataset.

You will want to follow the steps in Section 2 of this tutorial if you require fresh data)

### Pre-requisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need a cursory knowledge of the Structured Query 
Language (SQL). The tutorial will walk you through each SQL command, but it will be 
helpful if you've seen SQL before.

To start, [install TimescaleDB][install-timescale]. Once your installation is complete, 
we can proceed to ingesting or creating sample data and finishing the tutorial.

Finally, this tutorial leads directly into a second tutorial that covers
[how Timescale can be used with Tableau][tableau-tutorial] to visualize
time-series data.

### Step 1: Design the database schema

Now that our database is up and running we need some data to insert into it. 
Before we get data for analysis, we first need to define what kind of data we 
want to perform queries on.

In our analysis, we have two main goals.

- We want to explore the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, expressed in different fiat currencies, over time.
- We want to explore the price of different cryptocurrencies, expressed in Bitcoin, over time.

Examples of questions we might want to ask are:

- How has Bitcoin’s price in USD varied over time?
- How has Ethereum’s price in ZAR varied over time?
- How has Bitcoin’s trading volume in KRW increased or decreased over time?
- Which crypto has highest trading volume in last two weeks?
- Which day was Bitcoin most profitable?
- Which are the most profitable new coins from the past 3 months?

Understanding the questions required of the data informs our schema definition.

Our requirements lead us to four tables, specifically, three TimescaleDB hypertables, 
`btc_prices`, `crypto_prices`, and `eth_prices`, and one relational table, `currency_info`.

The `btc_prices` and `eth_prices` hypertables contain data about Bitcoin prices in 
17 different fiat currencies since 2010. The Bitcoin table is below and the Ethereum
table is very similar:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|`time`|The day-specific timestamp of the price records, with time given as the default 00:00:00+00|
|`opening_price`|The first price at which the coin was exchanged that day|
|`highest_price`|The highest price at which the coin was exchanged that day|
|`lowest_price`|The lowest price at which the coin was exchanged that day|
|`closing_price`|The last price at which the coin was exchanged that day|
|`volume_btc`|The volume exchanged in the cryptocurrency value that day, in BTC|
|`volume_currency`|The volume exchanged in its converted value for that day, quoted in the corresponding fiat currency|
|`currency_code`|Corresponds to the fiat currency used for non-btc prices/volumes|

Lastly, we have the `currency_info` table, which maps the currency's code to its English-language name:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|`currency_code`|2-7 character abbreviation for currency. Used in other hypertables|
|`currency`|English name of currency|

Once we’ve established the schema for the tables in our database, we can formulate 
`create_table` SQL statements to actually create the tables we need:

```sql
--Schema for cryptocurrency analysis
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "currency_info";
CREATE TABLE "currency_info"(
   currency_code   VARCHAR (10),
   currency        TEXT
);

--Schema for btc_prices table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "btc_prices";
CREATE TABLE "btc_prices"(
   time            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
   opening_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   highest_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   lowest_price    DOUBLE PRECISION,
   closing_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_btc      DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_currency DOUBLE PRECISION,
   currency_code   VARCHAR (10)
);

--Schema for crypto_prices table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "crypto_prices";
CREATE TABLE "crypto_prices"(
   time            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
   opening_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   highest_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   lowest_price    DOUBLE PRECISION,
   closing_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_crypto   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_btc      DOUBLE PRECISION,
   currency_code   VARCHAR (10)
);

--Schema for eth_prices table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "eth_prices";
CREATE TABLE "eth_prices"(
   time            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
   opening_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   highest_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   lowest_price    DOUBLE PRECISION,
   closing_price   DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_eth      DOUBLE PRECISION,
   volume_currency DOUBLE PRECISION,
   currency_code   VARCHAR (10)
);

--Timescale specific statements to create hypertables for better performance
SELECT create_hypertable('btc_prices', 'time');
SELECT create_hypertable('eth_prices', 'time');
SELECT create_hypertable('crypto_prices', 'time');
```

Note that we include three `create_hypertable` statements which are special TimescaleDB 
statements. A hypertable is an abstraction of a single continuous table across 
time intervals, such that one can query it via vanilla SQL. For more on hypertables, 
see the [Timescale docs][hypertable-docs] and this [blog post][hypertable-blog].

### Step 2: Create a dataset to analyze

Now that we’ve defined the data we want, it’s time to construct a dataset containing that 
data. To do this, we’ll write a small Python script for extracting data from [CryptoCompare][cryptocompare] 
into four CSV files (`coin_names.csv`, `crypto_prices.csv`, `btc_prices.csv`, and `eth_prices.csv`).

In order to get data from CryptoCompare, you’ll need to [obtain an API key][cryptocompare-apikey]. 
For this analysis, the free key should be plenty.

The script consists of five parts:

- Importing the necessary Python libraries in order to complete the data extraction
- Populate the `currency_info` table with a list of coin names
- Get the historical Bitcoin (BTC) prices in 4198 other cryptocurrencies and populate the `crypto_prices` table
- Get historical Bitcoin prices in different fiat currencies to populate `btc_prices`
- Get historical Ethereum prices in different fiat currencies to populate `eth_prices`

Here's the full Python script, which you can also <tag type="download" >[download](https://github.com/timescale/examples/blob/master/crypto_tutorial/crypto_data_extraction.py)</tag>

print('Done getting price data for eth. See eth_prices.csv for result')
```

After running the script, you will receive four CSV files:

```bash
python crypto_data_extraction.py
```

### Step 3: Load the dataset into TimescaleDB [](timescaledbsection)

To proceed, be sure you have a [working installation of TimescaleDB][install-timescale].

#### Setup our schema

Now all our hard work in Step 1 comes in handy! We will use the SQL script we created to
setup our instance of TimescaleDB. If you don't want to enter the SQL script by yourself,
you can always download <tag type="download" >[schema.sql](https://github.com/timescale/examples/blob/master/crypto_tutorial/schema.sql)</tag>.

Let's first login to our TimescaleDB instance. Locate your `host`, `port`, and `password`
and then connect to the database:

```bash
psql -x "postgres://tsdbadmin:{YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE}@{YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE}:{YOUR_PORT_HERE}/defaultdb?sslmode=require"
```

From the `psql` command line, we need to first create a database. Let's call it `crypto_data`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE crypto_data;
\c crypto_data
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
```

From your shell prompt, we will now apply our schema creation script to the database like this:

```bash
psql -x "postgres://tsdbadmin:{YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE}@{|YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE}:{YOUR_PORT_HERE}/crypto_data?sslmode=require" < schema.sql
```

Your output should look something like this:

```sql
NOTICE:  00000: table "currency_info" does not exist, skipping
LOCATION:  DropErrorMsgNonExistent, tablecmds.c:1057
DROP TABLE
Time: 78.384 ms
CREATE TABLE
Time: 87.011 ms
NOTICE:  00000: table "btc_prices" does not exist, skipping
LOCATION:  DropErrorMsgNonExistent, tablecmds.c:1057
DROP TABLE
Time: 77.094 ms
CREATE TABLE
Time: 79.815 ms
NOTICE:  00000: table "crypto_prices" does not exist, skipping
LOCATION:  DropErrorMsgNonExistent, tablecmds.c:1057
DROP TABLE
Time: 78.430 ms
CREATE TABLE
Time: 78.430 ms
NOTICE:  00000: table "eth_prices" does not exist, skipping
LOCATION:  DropErrorMsgNonExistent, tablecmds.c:1057
DROP TABLE
Time: 77.410 ms
CREATE TABLE
Time: 80.883 ms
    create_hypertable    
-------------------------
 (1,public,btc_prices,t)
(1 row)

Time: 83.154 ms
    create_hypertable    
-------------------------
 (2,public,eth_prices,t)
(1 row)

Time: 84.650 ms
     create_hypertable      
----------------------------
 (3,public,crypto_prices,t)
(1 row)

Time: 81.864 ms
```

Now when we log back into our TimescaleDB instance using `psql`, we can run the `\dt` command
and see that our tables have been created properly:

```sql
             List of relations
 Schema |     Name      | Type  |   Owner   
--------+---------------+-------+-----------
 public | btc_prices    | table | tsdbadmin
 public | crypto_prices | table | tsdbadmin
 public | currency_info | table | tsdbadmin
 public | eth_prices    | table | tsdbadmin
(4 rows)
```

#### Ingest our data

Now that we’ve created the tables with our desired schema, all that’s left is to insert the data 
from the CSV files we’ve created into the tables.

Make sure you are logged into TimescaleDB using `psql` so that you can run each of the
following commands successively:

```sql
\COPY btc_prices FROM btc_prices.csv CSV;
\COPY eth_prices FROM eth_prices.csv CSV;
\COPY crypto_prices FROM crypto_prices.csv CSV;
\COPY currency_info FROM coin_names.csv CSV;
```

<highlight type="warning">
 This data ingestion may take a while, depending on the speed of your Internet connection.
</highlight>

We can test that the ingestion worked by running a simple SQL command, such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM btc_prices LIMIT 5;
```

You should get something like the following output:

```sql
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+-----------------------

Time: 224.741 ms
```

### Step 4: Query and analyze our data

When we started the tutorial, we laid out a series of questions that we would like to answer.
Naturally, each of those questions has an answer in the form of a SQL query. Now that our database
is setup properly, our data is captured, and our data is ingested, we are able to proceed
and answer our questions.

For example, **How did Bitcoin price in USD vary over time?**

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('7 days', time) AS period,
      last(closing_price, time) AS last_closing_price
FROM btc_prices
WHERE currency_code = 'USD'
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period
```

**How did BTC daily returns vary over time? Which days had the worst and best returns?**

```sql
SELECT time,
      closing_price / lead(closing_price) over prices AS daily_factor
FROM (
  SELECT time,
         closing_price
  FROM btc_prices
  WHERE currency_code = 'USD'
  GROUP BY 1,2
) sub window prices AS (ORDER BY time DESC)
```

**How did the trading volume of Bitcoin vary over time in different fiat currencies?**

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('7 days', time) AS period,
      currency_code,
      sum(volume_btc)
FROM btc_prices
GROUP BY currency_code, period
ORDER BY period
```

**How did Ethereum (ETH) price in BTC vary over time?**

```sql
SELECT
   time_bucket('7 days', time) AS time_period,
   last(closing_price, time) AS closing_price_btc
FROM crypto_prices
WHERE currency_code='ETH'
GROUP BY time_period
ORDER BY time_period
```

**How did ETH prices, in different fiat currencies, vary over time?**

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('7 days', c.time) AS time_period,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) AS last_closing_price_in_btc,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) * last(b.closing_price, c.time) FILTER (WHERE b.currency_code = 'USD') AS last_closing_price_in_usd,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) * last(b.closing_price, c.time) FILTER (WHERE b.currency_code = 'EUR') AS last_closing_price_in_eur,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) * last(b.closing_price, c.time) FILTER (WHERE b.currency_code = 'CNY') AS last_closing_price_in_cny,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) * last(b.closing_price, c.time) FILTER (WHERE b.currency_code = 'JPY') AS last_closing_price_in_jpy,
      last(c.closing_price, c.time) * last(b.closing_price, c.time) FILTER (WHERE b.currency_code = 'KRW') AS last_closing_price_in_krw
FROM crypto_prices c
JOIN btc_prices b
   ON time_bucket('1 day', c.time) = time_bucket('1 day', b.time)
WHERE c.currency_code = 'ETH'
GROUP BY time_period
ORDER BY time_period
```

**Which cryptocurrencies had the most transaction volume in the past 14 days?**

```sql
SELECT 'BTC' AS currency_code,
       sum(b.volume_currency) AS total_volume_in_usd
FROM btc_prices b
WHERE b.currency_code = 'USD'
AND now() - date(b.time) < INTERVAL '14 day'
GROUP BY b.currency_code
UNION
SELECT c.currency_code AS currency_code,
       sum(c.volume_btc) * avg(b.closing_price) AS total_volume_in_usd
FROM crypto_prices c JOIN btc_prices b ON date(c.time) = date(b.time)
WHERE c.volume_btc > 0
AND b.currency_code = 'USD'
AND now() - date(b.time) < INTERVAL '14 day'
AND now() - date(c.time) < INTERVAL '14 day'
GROUP BY c.currency_code
ORDER BY total_volume_in_usd DESC
```

**Which cryptocurrencies had the top daily return?**

```sql
WITH
   prev_day_closing AS (
SELECT
   currency_code,
   time,
   closing_price,
   LEAD(closing_price) OVER (PARTITION BY currency_code ORDER BY TIME DESC) AS prev_day_closing_price
FROM
    crypto_prices  
)
,    daily_factor AS (
SELECT
   currency_code,
   time,
   CASE WHEN prev_day_closing_price = 0 THEN 0 ELSE closing_price/prev_day_closing_price END AS daily_factor
FROM
   prev_day_closing
)
SELECT
   time,
   LAST(currency_code, daily_factor) AS currency_code,
   MAX(daily_factor) AS max_daily_factor
FROM
   daily_factor
GROUP BY
