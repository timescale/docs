# Connecting to TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB can work with any tool that connects to PostgreSQL. In this section,
we provide some basic instructions on connecting with popular tools for running
queries against PostgreSQL.

In most cases, if you don't find instructions for a tool below or the instructions
we provide don't seem to work in your scenario, the tooling website
has up-to-date instructions for connecting.

Generally, you'll need to know the following information to connect any tool
to your TimescaleDB instance:

 * Hostname
 * Port
 * Username
 * Password
 * Database name

With that information ready to go, you can connect using one of these tools.


**[Connect with `psql`][connect-psql]**: `psql` is the standard command line interface for
interacting with a PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB instance and used in most of our
tutorials and documentation.
