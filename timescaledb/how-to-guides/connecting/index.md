# Connecting to TimescaleDB
When you have your TimescaleDB service up and running, either in the cloud or
own your own self-hosted hardware, you need a way to talk to it from your local
machine. Most of the instructions we give you assume you are using `psql`, but
that's not the only connection tool available to you. In this section, we give
you instructions for installing `psql`, as well as some other common tools.

*   [Learn about connecting to your database][about-connecting] to understand
    how it works before you begin.
*   [Learn about using psql][about-psql].
*   Install [psql][connect-psql].
*   Install and use [Azure Data Studio][connect-azure].
*   Install and use [DBeaver][connect-dbeaver].
*   Install and use [pgAdmin][connect-pgadmin].
