# Install and update TimescaleDB Toolkit

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the TimescaleDB Toolkit PostgreSQL
extension.

If you're using [Timescale Cloud][cloud], the Toolkit is already installed.

## Install and update Toolkit on Managed Service for TimescaleDB

On [Managed Service for TimescaleDB][mst], run this command on each database you
want to use the Toolkit with:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb_toolkit;
```

Update an installed version of the Toolkit using this command:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION timescaledb_toolkit UPDATE;
```

## Install Toolkit on self-hosted TimescaleDB

If you're hosting your own TimescaleDB database, you can install Toolkit by:

*   Using the TimescaleDB high-availability Docker image
*   Using a package manager such as `yum`, `apt`, or `brew` on platforms where
    pre-built binaries are available
*   Building from source

### Install Docker image

The recommended way to install the Toolkit is to use the
[TimescaleDB Docker image](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker-ha).
To get Toolkit, use the high availability image, `timescaledb-ha`:

```bash
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg14-latest
```

<highlight type="important">
The `timescaledb-ha` image does not support ARM64. For ARM64 environments, use the
`timescaledb` Docker image. By default, this image does not contain Toolkit. You can add
Toolkit using the package installation method, or by building from source.

For more information on running TimescaleDB using Docker, see the section on
[pre-built containers][docker-install].

### Install Toolkit on CentOS 7 and other Red Hat-based systems

and may also work on other Red Hat-based systems, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora.

<procedure>

#### Installing Toolkit on CentOS 7

1.  Make sure you have installed TimescaleDB and created a TimescaleDB
    repository in your `yum` `repo.d` directory. For more information, see [the

1.  Update your local repository list:

    ```bash
    yum update
    ```

1.  Install TimescaleDB Toolkit:

    ```bash
