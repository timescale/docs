# Last observation carried forward
Last observation carried forward (LOCF) is a form of linear interpolation used
to fill gaps in your data. It takes the last known value and uses it as a
replacement for the missing data.

For more information about gapfilling and interpolation API calls, see the
[hyperfunction API documentation][hyperfunctions-api-gapfilling].
