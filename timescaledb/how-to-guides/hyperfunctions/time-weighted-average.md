# Time-weighted average
Timescale's time weighted average is implemented as an aggregate that
weights each value using last observation carried forward (LOCF), or linear
interpolation. The aggregate is not parallelizable, but it is supported with
[continuous aggregation][caggs].

## Run a time-weighted average query
In this procedure, we are using an example table called `freezer_temps` that
contains data about internal freezer temperatures.

<procedure>

### Running a time-weighted average query
1.  At the `psql`prompt, find the average and the time-weighted average of
    the data:
    ```sql
    SELECT freezer_id,
      avg(temperature),
	    average(time_weight('Linear', ts, temperature)) as time_weighted_average
    FROM freezer_temps
    GROUP BY freezer_id;
    ```
1.  To determine if the freezer has been out of temperature range for more
    than 15 minutes at a time, use a time-weighted average in a window function:
    ```sql
    SELECT *,
    average(
	           time_weight('Linear', ts, temperature) OVER (PARTITION BY freezer_id ORDER BY ts RANGE  '15 minutes'::interval PRECEDING )
	          ) as rolling_twa
    FROM freezer_temps
    ORDER BY freezer_id, ts;
    ```

</procedure>
