# Time-weighted averages
Time weighted averages are used in cases where a time series is not evenly
sampled. Time series data points are often evenly spaced, for example every 30
seconds, or every hour. But sometimes data points are recorded irregularly, for
example if a value has a large change, or changes quickly. Computing an average
using data that is not evenly sampled is not always useful.

For example, if you have a lot of ice cream in freezers, you need to make sure
the ice cream stays within a 0-10℉ (-20 to -12℃) temperature range. The
temperature in the freezer can vary if folks are opening and closing the door,
but the ice cream will only have a problem if the temperature is out of range
for a long time. You can set your sensors in the freezer to sample every five
minutes while the temperature is in range, and every 30 seconds while the
temperature is out of range. If the results are generally stable, but with some
quick moving transients, an average of all the data points weights the transient
values too highly. A time weighted average weights each value by the duration
over which it occurred based on the points around it, producing much more
accurate results.
