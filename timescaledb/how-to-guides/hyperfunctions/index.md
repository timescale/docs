# Hyperfunctions
Hyperfunctions allow you to perform critical time-series queries quickly,
analyze time-series data, and extract meaningful information.

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

For more information, read the [hyperfunctions blog post][hyperfunctions-blog].

## Learn hyperfunction basics and install Timescale Toolkit
*   [Learn about hyperfunctions][about-hyperfunctions] to understand how they
    work before using them.
*   Install the [Toolkit extension][install-toolkit] to access more
    hyperfunctions.
