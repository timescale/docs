# Hyperfunctions
Hyperfunctions allows you to perform critical time-series queries quickly,
analyze time-series data, and extract meaningful information.

Some hyperfunctions are included in the default TimescaleDB product. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[Timescale Toolkit][install-toolkit] PostgreSQL extension.

*   [Learn about hyperfunctions][about-hyperfunctions] to understand how it works
    before you begin using it.
*   Install the [Toolkit extension][install-toolkit] to access more
    hyperfunctions.
*   Use the [approximate percentile][hyperfunctions-approximate-percentile] function.
*   Use the [time-weighted average][hyperfunctions-time-weighted-averages] function.
*   Use the [hyperloglog][hyperfunctions-hyperloglog] function.
*   Use the [counter aggregation][hyperfunctions-counteragg] function.
