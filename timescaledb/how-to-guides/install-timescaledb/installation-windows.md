## Windows ZIP Installer [](installation-windows)

**Note: TimescaleDB requires PostgreSQL 12 or 13.**

#### Prerequisites

- [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015][c_plus] (included in VS 2015 and later)
- A standard **PostgreSQL 13 64-bit** installation
- Make sure all relevant binaries are in your PATH: (use [pg_config][])
- Installation must be performed from an account with admin privileges

#### Build and install

1. Download the the [.zip file for your PostgreSQL version][windows-dl].
1. Extract the zip file locally
1. Run `setup.exe`, making sure that PostgreSQL is not currently running
1. If successful, a `cmd.exe` window will pop open and you will see the following:

```bash
TimescaleDB installation completed succesfully.
Press ENTER/Return key to close...
```
Go ahead and press ENTER to close the window

#### Updating from TimescaleDB 1.x to 2.0
Once the latest TimescaleDB 2.0 are installed, you can update the EXTENSION
in your database as discussed in [Updating Timescale to 2.0][update-tsdb-2].

#### Configure your database

There are a [variety of settings that can be configured][config] for your
new database. At a minimum, you will need to update your `postgresql.conf`
file to include our library in the parameter `shared_preload_libraries`.
If you ran `timescaledb-tune` during the install, you are already done.
If you did not, you can re-run the installer.

This will ensure that our extension is properly added to the parameter
`shared_preload_libraries` as well as offer suggestions for tuning memory,
parallelism, and other settings.

Then, restart the PostgreSQL instance.
