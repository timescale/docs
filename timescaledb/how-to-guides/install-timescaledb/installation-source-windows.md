## From Source (Windows) [](installation-source)

**Note: TimescaleDB requires PostgreSQL 11 or 12.**

#### Prerequisites

- A standard **PostgreSQL 13 64-bit** installation
- Visual Studio 2017 (with [CMake][] and Git components)
  **or** Visual Studio 2015/2016 (with [CMake][] version 3.11+ and Git components)
- Make sure all relevant binaries are in your PATH: `pg_config` and `cmake`

#### Build & Install with Local PostgreSQL
<highlight type="tip">
It is **highly recommended** that you checkout the latest
tagged commit to build from (see the repo's [Releases][github-releases] page for that)
</highlight>

Clone the repository from [GitHub][github-timescale]:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb.git
cd timescaledb
git checkout <release_tag>  # e.g., git checkout 2.2.1
```

If you are using Visual Studio 2017 with the CMake and Git components,
you should be able to open the folder in Visual Studio, which will take
care of the rest.

If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio:

<highlight type="warning">
This install step has to be made as admin.
</highlight>

```bash
# Bootstrap the build system
bootstrap.bat

# To build the extension from command line
cmake --build ./build --config Release

# To install
cmake --build ./build --config Release --target install

# Alternatively, open build/timescaledb.sln in Visual Studio and build,
# then open & build build/INSTALL.vcxproj
```

#### Update `postgresql.conf`

You will need to edit your `postgresql.conf` file to include
the TimescaleDB library, and then restart PostgreSQL. First, locate your
`postgresql.conf` file:

```bash
psql -d postgres -c "SHOW config_file;"
```

Then modify `postgresql.conf` to add the required library.  Note that
the `shared_preload_libraries` line is commented out by default.
Make sure to uncomment it when adding our library.

```bash
shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'
```
<highlight type="tip">
If you have other libraries you are preloading, they should be comma separated.
</highlight>

Then, restart the PostgreSQL instance.

#### Updating from TimescaleDB 1.x to 2.0
Once the latest TimescaleDB 2.0 are installed, you can update the EXTENSION
in your database as discussed in [Updating Timescale to 2.0][update-tsdb-2].
