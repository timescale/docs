# Aggregate time-series data with time_bucket
The `time_bucket` function helps you group your data, so you can perform
aggregate calculations over arbitrary time intervals. It is usually used
in combination with `GROUP BY` for this purpose.

This section shows examples of `time_bucket` use. To learn how time buckets
work, see the section that explains [time buckets][time-buckets].

## Group data by time buckets and calculate a summary value
Group data into time buckets and calculate a summary value for a column. For
example, calculate the average daily temperature in a table named
`weather_conditions`. The table has a time column named `time` and a
`temperature` column.
```sql
SELECT time_bucket('1 day', time) AS bucket,
  avg(temperature) AS avg_temp
FROM weather_conditions
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket ASC;
```

`time_bucket` returns the start time of the bucket. In this example, the first
bucket starts at midnight on November 15, 2016, and aggregates all the data from
that day:
```sql
bucket                 |      avg_temp       
-----------------------+---------------------
2016-11-15 00:00:00+00 | 68.3704391666665821
2016-11-16 00:00:00+00 | 67.0816684374999347
```

## Group data by time buckets and show the end time of the bucket
By default, the `time_bucket` column shows the start time of the bucket. If you
prefer to show the end time, you can shift the displayed time using a
mathematical operation on time.

For example, calculate the minimum and maximum CPU usage for 5-minute intervals.
Show the end of time of the interval. The example table is named `metrics`. It
has a time column named `time` and a CPU usage column named `cpu`.
```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5 min', time) + '5 min' AS bucket,
  min(cpu),
  max(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

The addition of `+ '5 min'` changes the displayed timestamp to the end of the
bucket. It doesn't change the range of times spanned by the bucket.

## Group data by time buckets and change the time range of the bucket
To change the time range spanned by the buckets, use the `offset` parameter,
which takes an `INTERVAL` argument. A positive offset shifts the start and end
time of the buckets later. A negative offset shifts the start and end time of
the buckets earlier.

For example, calculate the average CPU usage for 5-hour intervals. Shift the
start and end times of all buckets 1 hour later:
```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5 hours', time, '1 hour'::INTERVAL) AS bucket,
  avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

## Calculate the time bucket of a single value
Time buckets are usually used together with `GROUP BY` to aggregate data. But
you can also run `time_bucket` on a single time value. This is useful for
testing and learning, because you can see what bucket a value falls into.

For example, to see the 1-week time bucket into which January 5, 2021 would
fall, run:
```sql
SELECT time_bucket(INTERVAL '1 week', TIMESTAMP '2021-01-05');
```

The function returns `2021-01-04 00:00:00`. That is the start time of the
time bucket: the Monday of that week, at midnight.
