# Multi-node
If you have a larger workload, you might need more than one TimescaleDB
instance. TimescaleDB multi-node allows you to run and manage multiple instances,
giving you faster data ingest, and more responsive and efficient queries.

*   [Learn about multi-node][about-multi-node] to understand how it works
    before you begin using it.
*   Set up [multi-node][setup-selfhosted] in a self-hosted environment.
*   Set up [multi-node in Timescale Cloud][setup-cloud].
*   Set up [multi-node in Managed Service for TimescaleDB][setup-mst].
*   Set up [authentication][multi-node-auth] for your cluster
*   [Configure][multi-node-config] your cluster
*   [Grow or shrink][multi-node-grow-shrink] your cluster
*   [Backup and restore][multi-node-backup] your cluster
*   Set up [high availability][multi-node-ha] (HA) for your cluster
*   [Maintain][multi-node-maintenance] your multi-node environment
