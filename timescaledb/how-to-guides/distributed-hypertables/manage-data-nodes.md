# Data node management

When a distributed hypertable is created, it will use all the
available data nodes by default. It is possible, however, to use only
a subset of data nodes with a particular distributed hypertable. This
is useful to, e.g., tie a distributed hypertable to data nodes that
have a specific performance profile.

To view the data nodes used by a distributed hypertable, use the
following query:

```sql
SELECT hypertable_name, data_nodes
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables
WHERE hypertable_name = 'conditions';

 hypertable_name |              data_nodes
-----------------+---------------------------------------
 conditions      | {data_node_1,data_node_2,data_node_3}
```

If additional data nodes are added to a distributed database, the data
nodes are not automatically associated with existing distributed
hypertables. Instead, you need to explicitly *attach* a data node
using [`attach_data_node`][attach_data_node]:

```sql
SELECT add_data_node('node3', host => 'dn3.example.com');
SELECT attach_data_node('node3', hypertable => 'conditions');
```

When attaching a data node, the partitioning configuration of the
distributed hypertable is also updated to account for the additional
data node (i.e., the number of space partitions is automatically increased to
match), unless the function parameter `repartition` is set to
`FALSE`. The updated partitioning configuration ensures that the data
node will be able to take on newly created chunks.

In a similar way, if you want to remove a data node from a distributed
hypertable, you can use [`detach_data_node`][detach_data_node].

```sql
SELECT detach_data_node('node1', hypertable => 'conditions');
```

Note that you cannot detach a data node that still holds data for the
hypertable. To be able to detach a data node, ensure that either (1)
all its data is deleted first, or (2) the data is replicated on other
data nodes (see the next section on native replication).
