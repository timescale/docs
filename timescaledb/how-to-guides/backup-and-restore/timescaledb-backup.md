# The timescaledb-backup tool
The `timescaledb-backup` tool is designed to help you manage backing up and
restoring your TimescaleDB database. It resolves some of the common issues you
might come across when using the standard PostgreSQL
[dump and restore method][pg-dump-restore]. The `timescaledb-backup` tool uses
`pg_dump` and `pg_restore` in the background, and additionally:
*   Automatically tracks the installed version of TimescaleDB, and ensure that
    the correct version is restored.  
*   Runs all pre- and post-restore jobs at the correct times during the restore
    process.
*   Enables parallel restores by sequencing catalog and data restores during the
    restore process.

For more information about the `timescaledb-backup` tool, check out the source code in our [github repository][gh-repo-backup].

## Install timescaledb-backup
If you have installed the `timescaledb-tools` package, you already have the
`timescaledb-backup` tool. If you want to install it separately, you can use `go
get`, or download a binary from
[our release page](//github.com/timescale/timescaledb-backup/releases).

### Procedure: Installing timescaledb-backup
1.  Ensure you have installed these packages on the machine that you want to
    backup:
    *   `pg_dump`
    *   `pg_dumpall`
    *   `pg_restore`
1.  Install `timescaledb-backup`:
    ```bash
    $ go get github.com/timescale/timescaledb-backup/
    ```

## Back up your database
You can perform a backup using the `ts-dump` command at the command prompt. For
example, to backup a database named `exampledb`:
```bash
ts-dump --db-URI postgresql://user@example.com/exampledb --dump-dir ./backups/exampledb/
```

The two main parameters you need to specify are:
*   `--db-URI`: the location of the database that you want to back up. It should
    be in
    [Postgres URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) format, which is
    `postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][,...][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`. You can specify parameters in the URI as
    required, including passwords.
*   `--dump-dir`: the path to where the backup is stored. Make sure that the
    path to the directory exists, but the directory itself does not. The
    directory is created by the script.

When your backup is created, the dump directory is created. The dump directory
contains:
*   Subdirectory that contains the dump itself
*   An `.so` JSON file with the TimescaleDB version information
*   Any `sql` files generated by the script

<highlight type="tip">
Make sure that you retain all the files created by the script in the dump
directory. They are required when you restore, so that the tool knows which
version of PostgreSQL to use, and can restore your database correctly.

### Optional parameters for backing up
In addition to the two required parameters, you can specify these optional
parameters when you use the `ts-dump` command:

|Parameter|Description|Default|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|`--jobs`|The number of jobs to run for the dump|4|Runs in parallel mode, unless set to 0.|
|`--verbose`|Verbose output|False||
|`--dump-roles`|Uses `pg_dumpall` to dump roles (without password information) before running the dump.|True|Use to restore permissions on tables.|
|`--dump-tablespaces`|Uses `pg_dumpall` to dump tablespaces before running the dump.|True|Use if you have multiple tablespaces and need to restore tables to the correct tablespaces.|
|`--dump-pause-jobs`|Pauses background jobs that could disrupt a parallel dump process.|True|Only affects parallel dumps.|
|`--dump-pause-UDAs`|In TimescaleDB 2.0 and later, pauses user defined actions when pausing jobs.|True|Only affects parallel dumps where jobs are paused.|
|`--dump-job-finish-timeout`|The number of seconds to wait for jobs performing DDL to finish before timing out.|600 (10 minutes)|Only affects parallel dumps where jobs are paused. Set to -1 to not wait.|

## Restoring your database from backup
You can restore your database from backup using the `ts-restore` command at the
command prompt:

### Procedure: Restoring your database from backup
1.  Create a new, empty, database in the location you want to restore to. In
    this example, the new database is called `newdb`.
1.  Restore the database named `exampledb` to the new location, from the
    directory where the backup is stored:
    ```bash
    ts-restore --db-URI postgresql://user@example.com/newdb --dump-dir ./backups/exampledb/
    ```

The two main parameters you need to specify are:
*   `--db-URI`: the location of the new database that you want to restore to. It
    should already exist, but does not need to be set up. It should be in
    [Postgres URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) format, which is
    `postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][,...][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`. You can specify parameters in the URI as
    required, including passwords.
*   `--dump-dir`: the path to where the backup is stored.

By default, the `roles.sql` and `tablespaces.sql` files are in the backup
directory, and you do not need to restore them manually. However, if you want to
run them before you restore, you can use these commands:
```bash  
psql -d <db-URI> -f <dump-dir>/roles.sql  
psql -d <db-URI> -f <dump-dir>/tablespaces.sql
```

If you are restoring multiple databases on the same `postgres` instance, you
only need to restore the `roles.sql` and `tablespaces.sql` files once. If you
attempt to restore them multiple times, the script shows errors, but it does not
damage the database or the backup.


### Optional parameters for restoring
In addition to the two required parameters, you can specify these optional
parameters when you use the `ts-restore` command:

|Parameter|Description|Default|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|`--jobs`|The number of jobs to run for the restore|4|Runs in parallel mode where possible, unless set to 0.|
|`--verbose`|Verbose output|True||
|`--do-update`|Update the TimescaleDB version to the latest default version immediately after restore.|True|Requires the `.so` files for the version you are restoring from and the version that you are updating to.|

## Using timescaledb-backup to upgrade
In some instances, you can use the `timescaledb-backup` tool to upgrade your installed version. For example, if you are running a PostgreSQL 11 cluster on port 5432, and a PostgreSQL 12 cluster on port 5433, this command runs the dump on port 5432 in verbose mode with two workers:
```bash  
ts-dump --db-URI=postgresql://postgres:pwd1@localhost:5432/tsdb --dump-dir=~/dumps/dump1 --verbose --jobs=2
```
You can then restore to port 5433:
```bash
ts-restore --db-URI=postgresql://postgres:pwd1@localhost:5433/tsdb --dump-dir=~/dumps/dump1 --verbose --jobs=2
```
