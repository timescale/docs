# Backup and restore

TimescaleDB takes advantage of the reliable backup and restore functionality provided by PostgreSQL. There are a few different mechanisms you can use to backup your TimescaleDB database:
*   [Physical backups][physical-backups] with `pg_basebackup` or another tool.
*   [Ongoing physical backups][ongoing-physical-backups] using write-ahead log (WAL) archiving.
*   [Logical backups][logical-backups] with `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.
