# Hypertable best practices

Users of TimescaleDB often have two common questions:

1. How large should I configure my intervals for time partitioning?
1. Should I use space partitioning, and how many space partitions should I use?

## Time intervals:
The default time interval is 7 days. You can explicitly configure time
intervals when you create a hypertable, using the `chunk_time_interval` setting.
After the hypertable is created, you can change the interval for new chunks 
with [`set_chunk_time_interval`][set_chunk_time_interval].

The key property of choosing the time interval is that the chunk (including indexes)
belonging to the most recent interval (or chunks if using space
partitions) fit into memory.  As such, we typically recommend setting
the interval so that these chunk(s) comprise no more than 25% of main
memory.

If you want to see the current interval length for your hypertables, you can
check the `_timescaledb_catalog` as follows. Note that for time-based interval
lengths, these are reported in microseconds.

```sql
SELECT h.table_name, c.interval_length FROM _timescaledb_catalog.dimension c
  JOIN _timescaledb_catalog.hypertable h ON h.id = c.hypertable_id;

table_name | interval_length
-----------+-----------------
metrics    |    604800000000
(1 row)
```

<highlight type="tip">
Make sure that you are planning for single chunks from _all_ active hypertables
fit into 25% of main memory, rather than 25% per hypertable.
</highlight>

To determine this, you need to have a general idea of your data rate.  If
you are writing roughly 2GB of data per day and have 64GB of memory,
setting the time interval to a week would be good.  If you are writing
10GB per day on the same machine, setting the time interval to a day
would be appropriate.  This interval would also hold if data is loaded
more in batches, e.g., you bulk load 70GB of data per week, with data
corresponding to records from throughout the week.

While it's generally safer to make chunks smaller rather than too
large, setting intervals too small can lead to *many* chunks, which
corresponds to increased planning latency for some types of queries.

<highlight type="tip">
One caveat is that the total chunk size is actually dependent on
both the underlying data size *and* any indexes, so some care might be
taken if you make heavy use of expensive index types (e.g., some
PostGIS geospatial indexes).  During testing, you might check your
total chunk sizes via the 
[`chunks_detailed_size`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/chunks_detailed_size/) 
function.

## Space partitions
Space partitioning is optional but can make
sense for certain types of data and is recommended when using
distributed hypertables.

Space partitions use hashing: Every distinct item is hashed to one of
N buckets. In a distributed hypertable, each bucket of the primary
space dimension corresponds to a specific data node (although two or
more buckets could map to the same node). In non-distributed
hypertables, each bucket can map to a distinct disk (using, e.g., a
tablespace).

<highlight type="tip">
TimescaleDB does *not* benefit from a very large number of
space partitions (such as the number of unique items you expect in
partition field).  A very large number of such partitions leads both
to poorer per-partition load balancing (the mapping of items to
partitions using hashing), as well as increased planning latency
for some types of queries. We recommend tying the number of space
partitions to the number of disks and/or data nodes.
</highlight>

Spreading chunks along disks and nodes in the space dimension allows
for increased I/O parallelization, either by (a) having multiple
concurrent client processes, or, by (b) splitting the work of a single
client across multiple worker processes on a single node or multiple
concurrent requests across several data nodes.

In summary, to benefit from parallel I/O, one can do one of the
following:

- For each physical disk on a single instance, add a separate
tablespace to the database.  TimescaleDB actually allows you to add
multiple tablespaces to a *single* hypertable (although under the
covers, each underlying chunk is mapped by TimescaleDB to a
single tablespace / physical disk).

- Configure a distributed hypertable that spreads inserts and queries
across multiple data nodes.

Apart from the built-in parallel I/O support in the database, a more
transparent way to increase I/O performance is to use a RAID setup
across multiple physical disks, and expose a single logical disk to
the hypertable (i.e., via a single tablespace). With a RAID setup, *no
spatial partitioning is required* on a single node.
