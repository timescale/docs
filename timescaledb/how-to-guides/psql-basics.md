# Psql basic commands

Psql is the terminal-based front end to PostgreSQL, and is the primary tool used
to communicate with your TimescaleDB instances. Below is a refresher on some essential
psql commands that you may come across in our documentation, and will find useful
as you explore PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB.

For an in-depth breakdown of all commands, visit [psql's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html).

## Connections

Connect to a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB server via psql (using parameter flags):

```bash
psql -h host_name -p port -U username -W -d database_name
```

Connect to a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB server via psql (using a service URL):

```bash
psql "your_service_URL"
```

Show your psql version

```bash
psql --version
```

## Functions

Edit a function

```bash
\ef function_name
```

Display all functions

```bash
\df
```

Display all functions with more details (including owner, source code, and description)
```bash
\df+
```

## Views

List views from current schema

```bash
\dv
```

List views from all schemas
```bash
\dv+
```

## Users

Display PostgreSQL database roles
```bash
\du
```

Reset the password for a PostgreSQL database user
```bash
\password username
```

## Indexes and extensions

List all indexes from all tables

```bash
\di
```

Show all extensions installed
```bash
\dx
```

## Import and export CSV
The commands in this section can be used to import and export CSV files from your PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB database.

Import
```sql
\copy table_name FROM '/path/to/data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

Export
```sql
\copy (SELECT * FROM table_name) TO 'output_file.csv' WITH CSV HEADER
```

## Backup and restore

<highlight type="note">
The commands in this section use the `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall` tools.
</highlight>

Create a backup for a specific database in plan-text SQL script file
(with default backup options)

```bash
pg_dump database_name > database_name.bak.sql
```

Creates a backup for a specific database in plan-text SQL script file (with customized backup options)

```bash
pg_dump -c -C -F p -f database_name.bak.sql database_name
```

Run pg_dump on a client computer to back up data on a remote Postgres server

```bash
pg_dump -h remote_host -p port -U user -f database_name.bak mydb
```

Backup all databases along with database roles and cluster-wide information

```bash
pg_dumpall > alldb.bak.sql
```

Restore the database plain-text backup generated by pg_dump or pg_dumpall

```bash
psql -U username -f filename.sql
```

Restore the database custom-archive backup (.bak)

```bash
pg_restore -d database_name /path/to/your/file/database_name.bak -c -U database_user
```
