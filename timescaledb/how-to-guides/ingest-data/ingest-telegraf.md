of data.

For some suggestions of workarounds, see this
[Timescale Forum post](https://www.timescale.com/forum/t/telegraf-plugin/118).

Timescale have an unofficial build of Telegraf version 1.13.0 with the plugin
added. For more information about installing the Timescale Telegraf binaries
with the plugin, see the [telegraf-tutorial][telegraf-tutorial].
