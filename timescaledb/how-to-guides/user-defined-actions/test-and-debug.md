# Test and debug a user-defined action

To debug an action, you can increase the log level and run the job manually in
the foreground.

Use the [`run_job`][api-run_job] procedure, which takes a `job_id` argument.
Since `run_job` is a stored procedure and not a function, it needs to be
executed with [`CALL`][postgres-call] instead of `SELECT`.

<Procedure>

## Testing and debugging a job

1.  Change the minimum log level shown to the client. Set it to `DEBUG1`.

    ```sql
    SET client_min_messages TO DEBUG1;
    ```

1.  Run the job. Replace `1000` with your actual `job_id`.

    ```sql
    CALL run_job(1000);
    ```

To find the `job_id` for your job, query the `timescaledb_information.jobs`
table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.jobs;
```
