# Contributing to TimescaleDB

There are multiple ways to help make TimescaleDB better. All of our documentation
and source for the PostgreSQL extension are available to use and review via 
GitHub.

## Contributing to Timescale Documentation

Timescale documentation is hosted in a [GitHub repository][github-docs] 
and is open for contribution from all community members. If you 
find errors or would like to add content to our docs, this tutorial 
will walk you through the process.

### Making minor changes
If you want to make only minor changes to docs, you can make corrections 
and submit pull requests on the GitHub website. Go to the file you want to 
correct and click the 'pencil' icon to edit. Once done, GitHub gives you 
an option to submit a pull request at the bottom of the page.

### Making larger contributions to docs
In order to modify documentation, you should have a working knowledge 
of [git][install-git] and [Markdown][markdown-tutorial]. You will 
also need to create a GitHub account.

Be sure to read the [Timescale docs contribution styleguide][timescale-docs-style]. 
Youâ€™ll see information about how we refer to aspects of Timescale, 
how we format our docs, and special Markdown tags available to 
you as you author your contribution.

Before we accept any contributions, Timescale contributors need to
sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). By signing a CLA, we 
can ensure that the community is free and confident in its
ability to use your contributions. You will be prompted to sign the
CLA during the pull request process.
