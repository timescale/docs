## Narrow-table model

Most time-series databases would represent this data in the following way:
- Represent each metric as a separate entity (e.g., represent `cpu_1m_avg`
  and `free_mem` as two different things)
- Store a sequence of "time", "value" pairs for that metric
- Represent the metadata values as a "tag-set" associated with that
metric/tag-set combination

In this model, each metric/tag-set combination is considered an individual
"time series" containing a sequence of time/value pairs.

In this example, the approach would result in 9 different time
series, each of which is defined by a unique set of tags.
```
1. {name:  cpu_1m_avg,  device_id: abc123,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: field}
2. {name:  cpu_1m_avg,  device_id: def456,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: roof}
3. {name:  cpu_1m_avg,  device_id: ghi789,  location_id:  77,  dev_type: roof}
4. {name:    free_mem,  device_id: abc123,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: field}
5. {name:    free_mem,  device_id: def456,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: roof}
6. {name:    free_mem,  device_id: ghi789,  location_id:  77,  dev_type: roof}
7. {name: temperature,  device_id: abc123,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: field}
8. {name: temperature,  device_id: def456,  location_id: 335,  dev_type: roof}
9. {name: temperature,  device_id: ghi789,  location_id:  77,  dev_type: roof}
```

In general, your model has as many time series as the cardinality of all your
tags multiplied together. For example, if `name` has 10 possible values,
`device_id` has 5 possible values, `location_id` has 2 possible values, and
`dev_type` has 2 possible values, your model has 200 time series. Some
time-series databases struggle as cardinality increases. This limits the number
of device types and devices you can store in a single database.

TimescaleDB supports narrow models and does not suffer from the same cardinality
limitations as other time-series databases. A narrow model makes sense if you
collect each metric independently. It also allows you to add new metrics as you go, by
adding a new tag without requiring a formal schema change.

However, a narrow model is not as performant if you are collecting many metrics
with the same timestamp, since it requires writing a timestamp for each metric.
This ultimately results in higher storage and ingest requirements. Further,
queries that correlate different metrics are also more complex, since each
additional metric you want to correlate requires another JOIN. If you typically
query multiple metrics together, it is both faster and easier to store them in a
[wide table format][wide-table-format].
