# Why use TimescaleDB?

Is TimescaleDB the right choice for your legacy application or next great startup
idea?

As you will read in the next section, Core Concepts, TimescaleDB has been built
and designed from the ground up to bring the power of relational details to the
massive scale of time-series data. By building on the strong foundation of PostgreSQL
and utilizing the extension ecosystem, TimescaleDB can help you bring meaning to
hundreds of TBs of data (even Petabytes!) in a way that modern NoSQL databases
haven't been able to deliver on.

We often find that most users first look at TimescaleDB because it's
built with PostgreSQL, the fastest growing (and one of the most mature) database
platforms on the planet! But even for those that didn't start their time-series
journey with a SQL database, they quickly realize the power of using a standard
language like SQL that's consistent across tools and platforms.

When it comes to time-series data, TimescaleDB supercharges PostgreSQL to add
best-in-class features to support common issues with storing and processing large
amounts of data. Under most circumstances, asking developers and DBA's to
manage database partitioning and data retention policies would be a non-starter
for projects. But with TimescaleDB, these features are employed seamlessly and
easily, allowing your development team to focus on bringing value from the data.

Offering native Compression, Continuous Aggregates (Materialized VIEWs),
data retention and more, TimescaleDB brings many features to the strong, rock
solid foundation of PostgreSQL.
