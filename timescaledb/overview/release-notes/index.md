## 2.2.0 (2021-04-13)

This release adds major new features since the 2.1.1 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds the Skip Scan optimization, which significantly
improves the performance of queries with DISTINCT ON. This
optimization is not yet available for queries on distributed
hypertables.

This release also adds a function to create a distributed
restore point, which allows performing a consistent restore of a
multi-node cluster from a backup.

The bug fixes in this release address issues with size and stats
functions, high memory usage in distributed inserts, slow distributed
ORDER BY queries, indexes involving INCLUDE, and single chunk query
planning.

**PostgreSQL 11 deprecation announcement**

Timescale is working hard on our next exciting features. To make that
possible, we require functionality that is unfortunately absent on
PostgreSQL 11. For this reason, we continue supporting PostgreSQL
11 only until mid-June 2021. At some point before that time, we are going to
announce in which version of TimescaleDB PostgreSQL 11 support is dropped.

**Major features**

*   #2843 Add distributed restore point functionality
*   #3000 SkipScan to speed up SELECT DISTINCT

**Bug fixes**

*   #2989 Refactor and harden size and stats functions
*   #3058 Reduce memory usage for distributed inserts
*   #3067 Fix extremely slow multi-node order by queries
*   #3082 Fix chunk index column name mapping
*   #3083 Keep Append pathkeys in ChunkAppend

**Thanks**

*   @BowenGG for reporting an issue with indexes with INCLUDE
*   @fvannee for reporting an issue with ChunkAppend pathkeys
*   @pedrokost and @RobAtticus for reporting an issue with size
  functions on empty hypertables
*   @phemmer and @ryanbooz for reporting issues with slow
  multi-node order by queries
*   @stephane-moreau for reporting an issue with high memory usage during
  single-transaction inserts on a distributed hypertable.

## 2.1.1 (2021-03-29)

This maintenance release contains bug fixes since the 2.1.0 release. We
deem it high priority for upgrading.

The bug fixes in this release address issues with CREATE INDEX and
UPSERT for hypertables, custom jobs, and gapfill queries.

This release marks TimescaleDB as a trusted extension in PG13, so that
superuser privileges are not required anymore to install the extension.

**Minor features**

*   #2998 Mark timescaledb as trusted extension

**Bug fixes**

*   #2948 Fix off by 4 error in histogram deserialize
*   #2974 Fix index creation for hypertables with dropped columns
*   #2990 Fix segfault in job_config_check for cagg

## 2.1.0 (2021-02-22)

This release adds major new features since the 2.0.2 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds the long-awaited support for PostgreSQL 13 to TimescaleDB.
The minimum required PostgreSQL 13 version is 13.2 due to a security vulnerability
affecting TimescaleDB functionality present in earlier versions of PostgreSQL 13.

This release also relaxes some restrictions for compressed hypertables;
namely, TimescaleDB now supports adding columns to compressed hypertables
and renaming columns of compressed hypertables.

**Major Features**

*   #2779 Add support for PostgreSQL 13

**Minor features**

*   #2736 Support adding columns to hypertables with compression enabled
*   #2909 Support renaming columns of hypertables with compression enabled

## 2.0.2 (2021-02-19)

## 2.0.0 (2020-12-18)

With this release, we are officially moving TimescaleDB 2.0 to GA,
concluding several release candidates.

TimescaleDB 2.0 adds the much-anticipated support for distributed
hypertables (multi-node TimescaleDB), as well as new features and
enhancements to core functionality to give users better clarity and
more control and flexibility over their data.

Multi-node architecture:  In particular, with TimescaleDB 2.0, users
can now create distributed hypertables across multiple instances of
TimescaleDB, configured so that one instance serves as an access node
and multiple others as data nodes. All queries for a distributed
hypertable are issued to the access node, but inserted data and queries
are pushed down across data nodes for greater scale and performance.

Multi-node TimescaleDB can be self managed or, for easier operation,
launched within Timescale's fully managed cloud services.

This release also adds:

*   Support for user-defined actions, allowing users to define,
  customize, and schedule automated tasks, which can be run by the
  built-in jobs scheduling framework now exposed to users.
*   Significant changes to continuous aggregates, which now separate the
  view creation from the policy. Users can now refresh individual
  regions of the continuous aggregate materialized view, or schedule
  automated refreshing via  policy.
*   Redesigned informational views, including new (and more general)
  views for information about hypertable's dimensions and chunks,
  policies and user-defined actions, as well as support for multi-node
  TimescaleDB.
*   Moving all formerly enterprise features into our Community Edition,
  and updating Timescale License, which now provides additional (more
  permissive) rights to users and developers.

Some of the changes above (for example, continuous aggregates, updated
informational views) do introduce breaking changes to APIs and are not
backwards compatible. While the update scripts in TimescaleDB 2.0
upgrade databases running TimescaleDB 1.x automatically, some of these
API and feature changes may require changes to clients and/or upstream
scripts that rely on the previous APIs. Before upgrading, we recommend
reviewing upgrade documentation at docs.timescale.com for more details.

**Major features**

TimescaleDB 2.0 moves the following major features to GA:

*   #1923 Add support for distributed hypertables
*   #2006 Add support for user-defined actions
*   #2125 #2221 Improve Continuous Aggregate API
*   #2084 #2089 #2098 #2417 Redesign informational views
*   #2435 Move enterprise features to community
*   #2437 Update Timescale License

**Previous release candidates**

*   #2702 Release Candidate 4 (December 2, 2020)
*   #2637 Release Candidate 3 (November 12, 2020)
*   #2554 Release Candidate 2 (October 20, 2020)

improvements:

*   #2746 Optimize locking for create chunk API
*   #2705 Block tableoid access on distributed hypertable
*   #2730 Do not allow unique index on compressed hypertables
*   #2764 Bootstrap data nodes with versioned extension

## 2.0.0-rc1 (2020-10-06)

This release adds major new features and bug fixes since the 1.7.4 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds the long-awaited support for distributed hypertables to
TimescaleDB. With 2.0, users can create distributed hypertables across
multiple instances of TimescaleDB, configured so that one instance serves
as an access node and multiple others as data nodes. All queries for a
distributed hypertable are issued to the access node, but inserted data
and queries are pushed down across data nodes for greater scale and
performance.

This release also adds support for user-defined actions allowing users to
define actions that are run by the TimescaleDB automation framework.

In addition to these major new features, the 2.0 branch introduces _breaking_ changes
to APIs and existing features, such as continuous aggregates. These changes are not
backwards compatible and might require changes to clients and/or scripts that rely on
the previous APIs. Please review our updated documentation and do proper testing to
ensure compatibility with your existing applications.

The noticeable breaking changes in APIs are:

*   Redefined functions for policies
*   A continuous aggregate is now created with `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`
  instead of `CREATE VIEW` and automated refreshing requires adding a policy
  via `add_continuous_aggregate_policy`
*   Redesign of informational views, including new (and more general) views for
  information about policies and user-defined actions

This release candidate is upgradable, so if you are on a previous release (for example, 1.7.4)
you can upgrade to the release candidate and later expect to be able to upgrade to the
final 2.0 release. However, please carefully consider your compatibility requirements
_before_ upgrading.

**Major features**

*   #1923 Add support for distributed hypertables
*   #2006 Add support for user-defined actions
*   #2435 Move enterprise features to community
*   #2437 Update Timescale License

**Minor features**

*   #2011 Constify TIMESTAMPTZ OP INTERVAL in constraints
*   #2105 Support moving compressed chunks

**Bug fixes**

*   #1843 Improve handling of "dropped" chunks
*   #1886 Change ChunkAppend leader to use worker subplan
*   #2116 Propagate privileges from hypertables to chunks
*   #2263 Fix timestamp overflow in time_bucket optimization
*   #2270 Fix handling of non-reference counted TupleDescs in gapfill
*   #2325 Fix rename constraint/rename index
*   #2370 Fix detection of hypertables in subqueries
*   #2376 Fix caggs width expression handling on int based hypertables
*   #2416 Check insert privileges to create chunk

This release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.6.1 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds the long-awaited support for PostgreSQL 12 to TimescaleDB.

This release also adds a new default behavior when querying continuous
aggregates that we call real-time aggregation. A query on a continuous
aggregate now combines materialized data with recent data that has
yet to be materialized.

Note that only newly created continuous aggregates have this real-time
query behavior, although it can be enabled on existing continuous aggregates
with a configuration setting as follows:

ALTER VIEW continuous_view_name SET (timescaledb.materialized_only=false);

This release also moves several data management lifecycle features to the
Community version of TimescaleDB (from Enterprise), including data reordering
and data retention policies.

**Deprecation notice:**  Please note that with the release of Timescale 1.7, we are deprecating support for PostgreSQL 9.6.x and 10.x.
The current plan is that the Timescale 2.0 release later this year only supports PostgreSQL major versions 11.x, 12.x, or newer.

**Major features**

*   #1807 Add support for PostgreSQL 12
*   #1685 Add support for real-time aggregation on continuous aggregates

**Bug fixes**

*   #1665 Add ignore_invalidation_older_than to timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates view
*   #1750 Handle undefined ignore_invalidation_older_than

*   #1769 Add rescan function to CompressChunkDml CustomScan node
*   #1785 Fix last_run_success value in continuous_aggregate_stats view
*   #1801 Include parallel leader in plan execution
*   #1808 Fix ts_hypertable_get_all for compressed tables
*   #1828 Ignore dropped chunks in compressed_chunk_stats

**Licensing changes**

### 1.6.0 (2020-01-14)

This release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.5.1 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

The major new feature in this release allows users to keep the aggregated
data in a continuous aggregate while dropping the raw data with drop_chunks.
This allows users to save storage by keeping only the aggregates.

The semantics of the refresh_lag parameter for continuous aggregates has
been changed to be relative to the current timestamp instead of the maximum
value in the table. This change requires that an integer_now func be set on
hypertables with integer-based time columns to use continuous aggregates on
this table.

We added a timescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than parameter for continuous
aggregates. This parameter accept a time-interval (for example, 1 month). If set,
it limits the amount of time for which to process invalidation. Thus, if
timescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than = '1 month', then any modifications
for data older than 1 month from the current timestamp at modification time may
not cause continuous aggregate to be updated. This limits the amount of work
that a backfill can trigger. By default, all invalidations are processed.

For more information on this release, read the [announcement blog](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-1-6-data-retention-policies-for-continuous-aggregates/)
and [blog on downsampling](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-to-proactively-manage-long-term-data-storage-with-downsampling/).

**Major features**

**Minor features**

*   #1568 Add ignore_invalidation_older_than option to continuous aggs
*   #1575 Reorder group-by clause for continuous aggregates

### 1.5.1 (2019-11-12)

This maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.5.0 release. We deem it low
priority for upgrading.

In particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address potential
segfaults and no other security vulnerabilities. The bugfixes are related to bloom
indexes and updates from previous versions.

**Bugfixes**

*   #1523 Fix bad SQL updates from previous updates
*   #1526 Fix hypertable model
*   #1530 Set active snapshots in multi-xact index create

**Thanks**

*   @84660320 for reporting an issue with bloom indexes
*   @gumshoes @perhamm @jermudgeon @gmisagm for reporting the issue with updates

### 1.5.0 (2019-10-31)

This release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.4.2 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds compression as a major new feature.
Multiple type-specific compression options are available in this release
(including DeltaDelta with run-length-encoding for integers and
timestamps; Gorilla compression for floats; dictionary-based compression
for any data type, but specifically for low-cardinality datasets;
and other LZ-based techniques). Individual columns can be compressed with
type-specific compression algorithms as Postgres' native row-based format
are rolled up into columnar-like arrays on a per chunk basis.
The query planner then handles transparent decompression for compressed
chunks at execution time.

This release also adds support for migrating of chunks between tablespaces, as
well as support for parallel query coordination to the ChunkAppend node.
Previously ChunkAppend would rely on parallel coordination in the underlying
scans for parallel plans.

For more information on this release, read the [announcement
blog](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database)
and this [tutorial on data compression][compress-data].

### 1.4.0 (2019-07-18)

This release contains major new functionality for continuous aggregates
and adds performance improvements for analytical queries.

In version 1.3.0 we added support for continuous aggregates which
was initially limited to one continuous aggregate per hypertable.
With this release, we remove this restriction and allow multiple
continuous aggregates per hypertable.

This release adds a new custom node ChunkAppend that can perform
execution time constraint exclusion and is also used for ordered
append. Ordered append no longer requires a LIMIT clause and now
supports space partitioning and ordering by time_bucket.

For more information on this release, read the [announcement blog](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-1-4-introduces-better-performance-for-time-series-analytics/), [blog on implementing
constraint exclusion](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/implementing-constraint-exclusion-for-faster-query-performance/),
and [blog on using OrderedAppend](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/ordered-append-an-optimization-for-range-partitioning/).

### 1.3.0 (2019-05-06)

This release contains major new functionality that we call continuous aggregates.

Aggregate queries which touch large swathes of time-series data can take a long
time to compute because the system needs to scan large amounts of data on every
query execution. Our continuous aggregates continuously calculate the
results of a query in the background and materialize the results. Queries to the
continuous aggregate view are then significantly faster as they do not need to
touch the raw data in the hypertable, instead using the pre-computed aggregates
in the view.

Continuous aggregates are somewhat similar to PostgreSQL materialized
views, but unlike a materialized view, continuous
aggregates do not need to be refreshed manually; the view is refreshed
automatically in the background as new data is added, or old data is
modified. Additionally, it does not need to re-calculate all of the data on
every refresh. Only new and/or invalidated data is calculated. Since this
re-aggregation is automatic, it doesn't add any maintenance burden to your
database.

Our continuous aggregate approach supports high-ingest rates by avoiding the
high-write amplification associated with trigger-based approaches. Instead,
we use invalidation techniques to track what data has changed, and then correct
the materialized aggregate the next time that the automated process executes.

For more information on this release, read our [blog on continuous aggregates](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/continuous-aggregates-faster-queries-with-automatically-maintained-materialized-views/),
[our docs overview](/timescaledb/:currentVersion:/overview/core-concepts/continuous-aggregates/),
and visit this [tutorial](/getting-started/:currentVersion:/create-cagg/).

### 1.2.0 (2019-01-29)

**This is our first release to include Timescale-Licensed features, in addition to new Apache-2 capabilities.**

We are excited to be introducing new time-series analytical functions, advanced data lifecycle management capabilities, and improved performance.

*   **Time-series analytical functions**: Users can now use our `time_bucket_gapfill` function, to write complex gapfilling, last object carried forward, and interpolation queries.
*   **Advanced data lifecycle management**: We are introducing scheduled policies, which use our background worker framework to manage time-series data. In this release, we support scheduled `drop_chunks` and `reorder`.
*   **Improved performance**: We added support for ordered appends, which optimize a large range of queries - particularly those that are ordered by time and contain a LIMIT clause. Please note that ordered appends do not support ordering by `time_bucket` at this time.
*   **Postgres 11 Support**: We added beta support for PG11 in 1.1.0. We're happy to announce that our PG11 support is now out of beta, and fully supported.

This release adds code under a new license, LICENSE_TIMESCALE. This code can be found in `tsl`.

**For this release only**, you need to restart the database before running
`ALTER EXTENSION`

### 1.1.1 (2018-12-20)

This release contains bugfixes.

**High-level changes**

*   Fix issue when upgrading with pg_upgrade
*   Fix a segfault that sometimes appeared in long COPYs
*   Other bug and stability fixes

**Notable commits**

*   [f99b540] Avoid loading twice in parallel workers and load only from $libdir
*   [e310f7d] Don't throw errors when extension is loaded but not installed yet
*   [8498416] Free ChunkInsertStates when the es_per_tuple_exprcontext is freed

**Thanks**

*   @costigator for reporting the pg_upgrade bug
*   @FireAndIce68 for reporting the parallel workers issue
*   @damirda for reporting the copy bug

### 1.1.0 (2018-12-13)

Our 1.1 release introduces beta support for PG 11, as well as several performance optimizations aimed at improving chunk exclusion for read queries. We are also packaging our new timescale-tune tool (currently in beta) with our Debian and Linux releases. If you encounter any issues with our beta features, please file a GitHub issue.

**Potential breaking changes**

*   In addition to optimizing first() / last() to utilize indices for non-group-by queries, we adjusted its sorting behavior to match that of PostgreSQL's max() and min() functions. Previously, if the column being sorted had NULL values, a NULL would be returned. First() and last() now instead ignore NULL values.

### 1.0.0 (2018-10-30)

**This is our 1.0 release!**

For notable commits between 0.12.0/0.12.1 and this final 1.0 release, please see previous entries for the release candidates (rc1, rc2, and rc3).

**Thanks**
To all the external contributors who helped us debug the release candidates, as well as anyone who has contributed bug reports, PRs, or feedback on Slack, GitHub, and other channels. All input has been valuable and helped us create the product we have today!

**Potential breaking changes**

*   To better align with the ISO standard so that time bucketing starts each week by default on a Monday (rather than Saturday), the `time_bucket` epoch/origin has been changed from January 1, 2000 to January 3, 2000.  The function now includes an `origin` parameter that can be used to adjust this.
*   Error codes are now prefixed with `TS` instead of the prior `IO` prefix. If you were checking for these error codes by name, please update your code.
