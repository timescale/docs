# TimescaleDB overview

TimescaleDB is an open-source relational database for time-series data.  It
speaks "full SQL" and is correspondingly easy to use like a traditional relational
database, yet scales in ways previously reserved for NoSQL databases.

Compared to the trade-offs demanded by these two alternatives
(relational vs. NoSQL), TimescaleDB offers the best of both
worlds **for time-series data:**

## Easy to use

- **Full SQL interface** for all SQL natively supported by
PostgreSQL (including secondary indexes, non-time based aggregates,
sub-queries, JOINs, window functions).
- **Connects** to any client or tool that speaks PostgreSQL, no changes needed.
- **Time-oriented** features, API functions, and optimizations.
- Robust support for **Data retention policies**.


## Scalable

- **Transparent time/space partitioning** for both scaling up (single node)
and scaling out (forthcoming).
- **High data write rates** (including batched commits, in-memory
indexes, transactional support, support for data backfill).
- **Right-sized chunks** (two-dimensional data partitions) on single nodes to
ensure fast ingest even at large data sizes.
- **Parallelized operations** across chunks and servers.

## Reliable

- **Engineered up** from PostgreSQL, packaged as an extension.
- **Proven foundations** benefiting from 20+ years of PostgreSQL
research (including streaming replication, backups).
- **Flexible management options** (compatible with existing PostgreSQL
ecosystem and tooling).

The rest of this section describes the design and motivation around the TimescaleDB
architecture, including why time-series data is different, and how we leverage
its characteristics when building TimescaleDB.
