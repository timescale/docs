# Backup and restore

Backing up TimescaleDB takes advantage of the reliable functionality already
available through PostgreSQL.  There are several ways to accomplish this:
physical backups with [`pg_basebackup`][postgres-pg_basebackup] or another tool,
or logical backups with [`pg_dump`][pg_dump] and [`pg_restore`][pg_restore].
Physical backups may also be used with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) archiving to
achieve an ongoing backup.

If you have a multi-node deployment, make sure you can restore to a 
point that ensures consistency across all nodes. You can create a 
restore point with the
[`create_distributed_restore_point`][create_distributed_restore_point] 
function, and use it later when you restore from a physical backup.
