# Backup and restore

Backing up TimescaleDB takes advantage of the reliable functionality already
available through PostgreSQL.  There are several ways to accomplish this:
physical backups with [`pg_basebackup`][postgres-pg_basebackup] or another tool,
or logical backups with [`pg_dump`][pg_dump] and [`pg_restore`][pg_restore].
Physical backups may also be used with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) archiving to
achieve an ongoing backup.

<highlight type="warning">
TimescaleDB currently does not natively support a consistent restore point for
multi-node environments. Care should be taken to ensure third-party solutions
properly quiesce the environment before backing up, so that the backup point used
across nodes does not have outstanding transactions.
