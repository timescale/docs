# User-defined actions

User-defined actions allow you to run functions and procedures implemented in a
language of your choice on a schedule within TimescaleDB. This allows
automatic periodic tasks that are not covered by existing policies, or the
ability to enhance existing policies with additional features.

To learn more about user-defined actions, see the [how-to guide][how-to].
