# How does TimescaleDB compare?

TimescaleDB is often compared to both plain, vanilla relational databases (ie.
PostgreSQL) and NoSQL variants like InfluxDB or MongoDB. While these technologies,

applications need a modern data architecture.

See how we compare to both regular SQL and NoSQL databases, especially when
petabyte scale time-series data is key to your application's success!
