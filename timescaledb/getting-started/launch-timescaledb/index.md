# Launch your first instance of TimescaleDB

You can launch your first TimescaleDB instance in several ways. The two most
popular options are:
*   Creating an instance on Timescale Cloud, a cloud-based managed database
    service
*   Creating a Docker container instance using the official TimescaleDB Docker
    image

In this section, learn how to launch a TimescaleDB instance using either method.

Timescale Cloud combines the power and reliability of TimescaleDB with a fully managed, cloud-native 
experience that is easy to start and less expensive to operate. Creating a Timescale Cloud account 
is fast and straightforward, allowing you to explore TimescaleDB free for 30 days, no credit card 
required.

Creating a TimescaleDB Docker is a quick and useful alternative to using Timescale 
Cloud, but it requires maintaining the database. You need to have Docker installed on 
your local machine to use this option.
