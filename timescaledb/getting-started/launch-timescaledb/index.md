# Launch your first instance of TimescaleDB

There are many great options for creating your first TimescaleDB instance. However, the two most popular options include launching an instance with our Cloud-based service, or creating a Docker container instance using the official TimescaleDB Docker image. In this section, we give you information on how to launch a TimescaleDB instance using either method.

Timescale Cloud combines the power and reliability of TimescaleDB with a fully managed, cloud-native experience that is easy to start and less expensive to operate. Creating a Timescale Cloud account is fast and simple, allowing you to explore TimescaleDB free for 30 days, no credit card required.

Creating a TimescaleDB Docker instance can be a quick and useful alternative to using Timescale Cloud, but requires that you maintain the database. To use this option, you will need to have Docker installed on your local machine.
