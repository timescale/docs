# Launch your first instance of TimescaleDB

There are many great options for creating your first TimescaleDB instance. However, the two most
popular options include launching an instance with our Cloud-based service or creating a Docker 
container instance using the official TimescaleDB Docker image. This section gives you information 
on how to launch a TimescaleDB instance using either method.

Timescale Cloud combines the power and reliability of TimescaleDB with a fully managed, cloud-native 
experience that is easy to start and less expensive to operate. Creating a Timescale Cloud account 
is fast and straightforward, allowing you to explore TimescaleDB free for 30 days, no credit card 
required.

Creating a TimescaleDB Docker instance can be a quick and useful alternative to using Timescale 
Cloud but requires maintaining the database. Additionally, you will need to have Docker installed on 
your local machine to use this option.
