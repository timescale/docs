# Getting started with TimescaleDB

**Congratulations!** You're likely here because you have successfully spun up your first instance of TimescaleDB, can connect to it, and are ready to explore some of the most popular TimescaleDB feautures. If you have not yet created a TimescaleDB instance or learned how to connect to it, make sure to first check out these two sections within the docs:
 * [Install TimescaleDB][install]
 * [Connecting to TimescaleDB][connecting]


## What is TimescaleDB?
TimescaleDB is an extension on top of the PostgreSQL. When you use TimescaleDB, you get all the time-series optimizations and special functionality that TimescaleDB provides, along with all the features available in native PostgreSQL. Developers often refer to TimescaleDB as PostgreSQL with superpowers.

TimescaleDB supports the full SQL language and you can use TimescaleDB with
all the tools and connectors within the PostgreSQL ecosystem. If it works with
PostgreSQL, it works with TimescaleDB!

## Let's get up and running
This Getting Started section gives you a hands-on introduction to the 
fundamentals of TimescaleDB. Using a real-world dataset, you'll learn definitions
of key terms (like hypertables and chunks), mental models for working with
TimescaleDB, and TimescaleDB's key features (like continuous aggregation,
data retention, and compression) along when, why, and how to use them.
