# Getting started with TimescaleDB

**Congratulations!!** You're ready to jump in and start using TimescaleDB. Smart
move!

## What is TimescaleDB?
Developers often refer to TimescaleDB as PostgreSQL with time-series superpowers.
Put another way, TimescaleDB is a relational database with native time-series
optimizations to make ingesting, storing and analyzing time-series data at petabyte
scale fast and easy. TimescaleDB is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension. It also
supports all the standard PostgreSQL database objects, like tables, indexes,
triggers, and more. Moreover, a TimescaleDB database is able to coexist with
PostgreSQL database (and other TimescaleDB databases) on a single server.


TimescaleDB also supports the full SQL language and you can use TimescaleDB with
all the tools and connectors in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. If it works with
PostgreSQL, it works with Timescale!

## Let's get up and running
This Getting Started section gives you a hands-on introduction to the 
fundamentals of TimescaleDB. Using a real-world dataset, you'll learn definitions
of key terms (like hypertables and chunks), mental models for working with
TimescaleDB, as well as TimescaleDB's key features (like continuous aggregation,
compression and data retention) and when, why and how to use them.
