# Next Steps

Now that you've had some hands-on experience with TimescaleDB, hopefully you can 
see how many of our powerful features can help you manage your time-series data
while easily mining for deeper insights. ðŸ’¥

To continue your exploration of TimescaleDB, here are some valuable next steps
to help you on your way to becoming a time-series superhero.


## Migrate data to TimescaleDB

One of the first things most developers want to do is look at the data they're
currently working with in the database. There are a number of methods for 
importing data that you currently have, whether it exists in another database
or a CSV file.

Look at our [how-to guide on Migrating Data][migrate-data] for more help and suggestions of 
where to start.


## Visualize your data

Time-series data is perfectly suited for viewing with tools like Grafana, 
Tableau, and Power BI (to name a few). Once you can see trends and query
for specific data features using relational data, a whole new world of insights
begins to open up.

Check out our [growing set of visualization tutorials][visualize-data], showing you how to become a Grafana 
Superhero and connect to other 3rd party visualization tools.


## Connect to your data with code

While this may the century of big data, the power greatest power often happens
in connected applications that help us ingest and provide value to users. Using
time-series data effectively means you need to get your code connected and 
working as efficiently as possible. 

See our [growing list of language Quick Starts][connect-with-code] to get you up and running with
TimescaelDB, including best practices.

## Examine other sample datasets

Sometimes it's just easier to explore further by having access to additional
datasets. We have you covered! ðŸ™Œ

Have a look some of the [other datasets][sample-data] we provide for you to dig deeper into
time-series data and data analysis using TimescaleDB.
