## LlamaIndex integration

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a popular data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models (LLMs). Timescale Vector has a native LlamaIndex integration, enabling you to use Timescale Vector as a vector store and leverage all its capabilities in your applications built with LlamaIndex.

Here are resources about using Timescale Vector with LlamaIndex:

- [Getting started with LlamaIndex and Timescale Vector](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/Timescalevector.html): You'll learn how to use Timescale Vector for (1) similarity search, (2) time-based vector search, (3) faster search with indexes, and (4) retrieval and query engine.
- [Time-based retrieval](https://youtu.be/EYMZVfKcRzM?si=I0H3uUPgzKbQw__W): Learn how to power RAG applications with time-based retrieval.
- [Llama Pack: Auto Retrieval with time-based search](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/llama_packs/timescale_vector_autoretrieval): This pack demonstrates performing auto-retrieval for hybrid search based on both similarity and time, using the timescale-vector (PostgreSQL) vector store.
