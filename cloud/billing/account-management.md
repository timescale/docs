If you haven't yet added a payment method, you can add one in this section. You
can also update to a new credit card here.

    the `Billing` details section.

    your saved credit card.

<highlight type="note">
The first charge on your new credit card is for the period from the date you
added the card, to the end of that calendar month. After that, all payment
confirmations are for usage from the first of the month, to the last day of the
month.

## Add or change your billing email address
By default, your Timescale Cloud payment confirmations are sent to the email
address that you used when you signed up. This is also the address that receives
alerts about your Timescale Cloud services. If you want your payment
confirmations to also go to a different email address, for example the email address
for your finance department, you can add it in the `Billing` details section.

<highlight type="note">
When you add a billing email address, payment confirmations are sent to both the
email address you add, and the original email address that you signed up with.

    sent to, and click `Add email`. A confirmation email is sent to the email
    address you entered.

    address. Another email is sent to the address you signed up with to notify
    that the new email address is saved.
