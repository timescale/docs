# Multi-factor user authentication

You can use two-factor authentication to log in to your Timescale Cloud account.
Two-factor authentication, also known as two-step verification or 2FA, enables
secure logins that requires an authentication code in addition to your user
password. The code is provided by an app on your mobile device, such as Google
Authenticator.

## Configure two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator

Google Authenticator is a useful app for keeping track of your two-factor
authentication keys. However, if you want something more open-source, there
are other authenticators available to suit your needs.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

*   Installed the [Google Authenticator application][install-google-authenticator]
  on your mobile device.

<procedure>

### Configuring two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator

1.  [Log in to your Timescale Cloud account][cloud-login].
1.  Click the `User name` icon in the top-right of the console and select `Account`.
1.  In the `Account` page, click `Add two-factor authentication`.
1.  On your mobile device, open Google Authenticator, tap `+`, and select
    `Scan a QR code`.
1.  On your mobile device, scan the QR code provided by Timescale Cloud in the
    `Connect to an authenticator app` dialog and click `Next`.
1.  In the dashboard, type the verification code provided by Google
    Authenticator, and click `Next`.
1.  In the `Save your recovery codes` dialog, copy, download, or print the
    recovery codes, and save them in a safe place. These are used to recover
    your account if you lose your device.
1.  Verify that you have saved your recovery codes, by clicking `OK, I saved my
    recovery codes`.
1.  If two-factor authentication is enabled correctly, an email notification is
    sent to you.

</procedure>

<highlight type="warning">
If you lose access to the mobile device you use for multi-factor authentication,
and you do not have access to your recovery codes, you cannot sign in to your
TimescaleDB Cloud account. To regain access to your account, on the login
screen, click `Forgot password?` and follow the step to reset your password.
When you have regained access to your account, reconfigure multi-factor
authentication.
</highlight>

## Regenerate recovery codes

If you do not have access to your authenticator app and need to log in to
Timescale Cloud you can use your recovery codes. After you use a recovery code
to regain access to your account, it cannot be reused. If you've used all 10
recovery codes, you can generate another list of codes. Generating a new set of
recovery codes invalidates all previously generated codes. You can also
regenerate your codes if you lose access to your previous codes.

<procedure>

### Regenerating recovery codes

1.  [Log in to your Timescale Cloud account][cloud-login].
1.  Click the `User name` icon in the top-right of the console and select `Account`.
1.  In the `Account` page, navigate to the `Two-factor authentication` section.
1.  Click `Regenerate recovery codes`. 
1.  In the `Two-factor authentication` dialog, type the verification code from
    your authenticator application.
    Alternatively, if you do not have access to the authenticator application,
    click `Use recovery code instead` to type the recovery code.
1.  Click `Next`.
1.  In the `Save your recovery codes` dialog, copy, download, or print the
    recovery codes, and save them in a safe place. These are used to recover
    your account if you lose your device.
1.  Verify that you have saved your recovery codes, by clicking `OK, I saved my recovery codes`.

</procedure>

## Remove two-factor authentication

If you need to enroll a new device for two-factor authentication, you can 
remove two-factor authentication from your account and then add it 
again with your new device.

<procedure>

### Removing two-factor authentication

1.  [Log in to your Timescale Cloud account][cloud-login].

1.  In the `Account` page, navigate to the `Two-factor authentication` section.
1.  Click `Remove two-factor authentication`.
1.  In the `Are you sure` dialog, type the verification code from your
    authenticator application. Alternatively, if you do not have access to the
