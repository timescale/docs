# Service settings - advanced parameters
It is also possible to configure a wide variety of Service database parameters
by toggling `Show advanced parameters` in the upper-right corner of the
`Settings` tab.

Once toggled, a scrollable (and searchable) list of configurable parameters is
displayed.

As with the basic database configuration parameters, any changes are highlighted
and the `Apply changes` (or `Restart and apply changes`) button is available to
click, prompting you to confirm any changes before the Service is modified.

## Multiple databases
To create more than one Timescale Cloud database, you need to create a new
service for each database. Timescale Cloud does not support multiple
databases within the same service. Having a separate service for each database
affords each database its own isolated resources.

Another option is to use
[schemas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html).
Schemas provide a way to organize tables into logical groups. A single
database can contain multiple schemas, which in turn contain tables.
The main difference between isolating with databases versus schemas
is that a user can access objects in any of the schemas in the database
they are connected to, so long as they have the corresponding privileges.
Schemas can help isolate smaller use cases that do not warrant their
own service.

## PostgreSQL extensions
You can use PostgreSQL extensions with Timescale Cloud. If you run
`pg_available_extensions` at the command prompt, the returned list of extensions
is inaccurate. To see the allowed extensions, use this command instead:
```sql
SELECT pae.* FROM current_setting('extwlist.extensions') AS cs(e) CROSS JOIN regexp_split_to_table(e, ',') AS ext(allowed) JOIN pg_available_extensions AS pae ON (allowed=name) ORDER BY 1;
```
