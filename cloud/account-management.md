# Account management
You can manage billing for your Timescale Cloud account by navigating to the
`Billing` details section in your Cloud console. From here, you can see your
monthly usage, past payments you have made, the estimated cost of your next
bill, and your current payment method.

## Add or change payment methods
If you haven't yet added a payment method, you can add one in this section. You
can also update to a new credit card here.

## Add or change your billing email address
By default, your Timescale Cloud bills are sent to the email address that you
used when you signed up. This is also the address that receives alerts about
your Timescale Cloud services. If you want your bills to go to a different email
address, for example the email address for your finance department, you can add
it in the `Billing` details section.
