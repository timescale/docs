# Timescale Cloud Explorer
Timescale Cloud Explorer provides a rich administrative dashboard for
understanding the state of your database instance. The Explorer gives you
insight into the performance of your database, giving you greater confidence and
control over your data.

The Explorer works like an operations center as you develop and run your
applications on TimescaleDB. It gives you quick access to the key properties of
your database, like table sizes, schema definitions, and foreign key references,
as well TimescaleDB specific information, like information on your hypertables
and continuous aggregates.

You can see the Explorer in your Timescale Cloud account by navigating to
the `Services` section, clicking the service you want to explore, and selecting
the `Explorer` tab.

## General information
In the `General information` section of the Explorer, you can see a high-level
summary of your TimescaleDB database, including all your hypertables and
relational tables. It summarizes your overall compression ratios, and other
policy and continuous aggregate data. And, if you aren't already using key
features like TimescaleDB's native compression, continuous aggregates, or other
automation policies and actions, it provides pointers to tutorials and
documentation to help you get started.

## Tables
In the `Tables` section of the Explorer, you can see a detailed look into all
your tables, including information about table schemas, table indexes, and
foreign keys. For your hypertables, it shows details about chunks, continuous
aggregates, and policies such as data retention policies and data reordering.
You can also inspect individual hypertables, including their sizes, dimension
ranges, and compression status.

[hypertables section][hypertables].

## Continuous aggregates
In the `Continuous aggregate` section, you can see all your continuous
aggregates, including top-level information such as their size, whether they are
configured for real-time aggregation, and their refresh periods.
