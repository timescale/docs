# Create and connect a Timescale Cloud VPC with AWS

## Setup
Before you begin, log in to the
[Timescale Cloud console](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/).

## Create a new VPC
In the Timescale Cloud console, click `VPC` in the left navigation bar to go to the VPC
dashboard. You can add new VPCs here for your Timescale Cloud services to attach to.
The VPCs created here are peered with your own VPC as part of the setup process.

Click `Create VPC`, type a name for your new VPC, and provide an IPv4 CIDR block
(E.G., `10.0.0.0/16` or `192.168.0.0/24`). Make sure that the CIDR block you
choose for your Timescale Cloud VPC does not overlap with the AWS VPC you are using to create
a peering connection. If the CIDR blocks overlap, the peering process fails.
You can always find the CIDR block of your AWS VPC from the AWS console.

<highlight type="tip">
VPC peering can be enabled for free during your Timescale Cloud trial, but you are required to enter a valid payment method in order to create a VPC (even though you
are not yet charged for it).
</highlight>

## Create a peering connection
When you have created a Timescale Cloud VPC, you are ready to create a peering connection
between your Cloud VPC and your cloud VPC. To do this, click the `Add` text in
the `VPC Peering` column for the Cloud VPC that you would like to connect.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tsc-vpc-addpeering.png" alt="Expand the VPC Peering dropdown menu and enter info"/>

In the form that is displayed, enter the AWS Account ID, AWS VPC ID, and AWS region of your
cloud VPC for the new peering connection. When you have entered the correct
information, click `Add peering connection` to begin the peering process.

This process is asynchronous, and results in a peering connection sent to your
AWS account for you to accept. This is an important safety mechanism â€” never
accept a peering connection from an unknown account.

Navigate to the AWS console's
[Peering Connections](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#PeeringConnections:)
dashboard. Find the new peering connection request sent from Timescale Cloud, and
accept the request.

<highlight type="tip">
Make note of the peering connection ID (starting with `pcx-`) as it is used in the next step.

## Network routing and security in AWS
Once you have accepted the peering connection, the two VPCs are peered;
however, in order to use this peering connection, you need to update your
VPC's route table to include the CIDR block of your peered Timescale Cloud VPC,
and you also need to update your VPC's security groups.

### Route table
Within the AWS console, navigate to the
[Route Tables](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#RouteTables:sort=routeTableId)
dashboard. Select the route table corresponding to your VPC. From the detail menu, select
the `Routes` tab and click the `Edit routes` button.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/aws-vpc-routetable.png" alt="Route table on AWS"/>

From this view, click `Add route`. In the `Destination` column of the new row,
enter the CIDR block of the Timescale Cloud VPC for which the peering connection
was configured in the previous few steps.

In the `Target` column, enter the peering connection ID (starting with `pcx-`)
noted in the previous step where you created the peering connection.

No other configuration is needed here, so click `Save routes`. This
configuration allows network traffic to flow from your VPC, across the peering
connection, and over to the Timescale Cloud VPC where your TimescaleDB services reside.

### Security groups
Within the AWS console, navigate to the
[Security Groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#securityGroups:)
dashboard. From this view, click `Create security group` to create a new security group.

<highlight type="tip">
If you need to, you can use another security group which already exists in your VPC,
however, for simplicity we assume the creation of a new security group.
</highlight>

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/aws-vpc-securitygroup.png" alt="The AWS Security Groups dashboard"/>

From the `Create security group` view, enter a name for your security group. Add whatever
content you would like to the description field. For the `VPC` field, select the VPC
which has been peered with your Cloud VPC.

No inbound rules are required, so leave the inbound rules section empty.

In the outbound rules section, select `Custom TCP` for the rule type. The protocol
should remain as TCP. The port range should be `5432`, which is the port which is
used to connect to your Timescale Cloud services. The Destination should be set
to `Custom` and the value should be the CIDR block of your Cloud VPC.

<highlight type="tip">
AWS may pre-populate the `Destination` column with the value `0.0.0.0/0`. Though this
value certainly works, it is more "open" than needed, and should be deleted.
</highlight>

Finally, click `Create security group`. With this step, you are now able to
connect to any of your Timescale Cloud services attached to your peered VPC. In the next
section, you learn how to create a Timescale Cloud service with a VPC attachment.

## Create a service with VPC attachment
In the Timescale Cloud console, navigate to the
[Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/dashboard/services). Click
`Create service` and select the compute and disk size which fits your needs.

Expand the dropdown menu under the `Select a VPC` step and select the VPC you created
previously. If you have multiple VPCs, select the VPC which you want your new service
to be attached to.

Click `Create Service`, and Timescale Cloud creates your new service. Due to
selecting a VPC during setup, your new service is created with an attachment to
your selected VPC.
