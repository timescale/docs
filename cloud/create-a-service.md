# Exploring Timescale Cloud
Welcome to Timescale Cloud! Timescale Cloud is a cloud-native TimescaleDB as a
service that is easy to get started and powerful enough for the most demanding
scenarios. This tutorial walks you through setting up your Timescale Cloud
account and completing your first tutorial project.

### Create a Timescale Cloud account
Sign up for Timescale Cloud by visiting [console.cloud.timescale.com][cloud-signup].
Provide your full name, email address, and a strong password to start:

You need to confirm your account by clicking the link you receive by email.
If you do not receive this link, check your spam folder first, then
[contact us][contact-timescale].

### Create your first service
When you have completed account verification, visit the
[Timescale Cloud console][cloud-console] and login with your credentials.

To begin, click `Create service`.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/forge_create-db.png" alt="Set up a Timescale Forge service"/>

1.  Supply your service name (for example, `acmecorp-test` or `acmecorp-dev`).
1.  Choose your CPU and memory configuration, from 0.25&nbsp;CPU and 1&nbsp;GB
    RAM, to 32&nbsp;CPU and 128&nbsp;GB RAM.
1.  Select your storage requirements, from 10&nbsp;GB to 1&nbsp;TB.  Note that
    with TimescaleDB compression, this is typically equivalent to 170&nbsp;GB
    to 67&nbsp;TB or more of uncompressed storage (although compression rates can vary based on your data).
1.  Note the estimated cost of running your chosen configuration. Feel free to
    [contact us][contact-timescale] if you would like to discuss pricing and
    configuration options best suited for your use case.
1.  Click `Create service` when your configuration is complete.

<highlight type="tip">
Don't worry too much about the size settings that you choose initially.
With Timescale Cloud, it's easy to modify both the compute (CPU/Memory) and
storage associated with the service that you just created. As you get to know
TimescaleDB and how your data processing needs vary, it's easy to [right-size
your service with a few clicks](/cloud/latest/scaling-a-service/)!
</highlight>

After you select `Create service`, you will see confirmation of your service
account and password information. You should save the information in this
confirmation screen in a safe place:

<highlight type="warning">
If you forget your password, you can reset it from the `Operations` menu in the service dashboard.
</highlight>

It takes a couple minutes for your service to be provisioned. When your
database is ready for connection, a green `Running` label shows above
the service in the service dashboard.

Select any service to view *service details*. You can obtain connection,
configuration, and utilization information. In addition, you can reset the
password for your service, power down or power up any service (which stops
or starts your compute, although your storage persists), or delete
a service altogether.
