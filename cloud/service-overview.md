# Service overview

When you log in to your [Timescale Cloud account][cloud-login], you see the
`Services` page. Click the service you are interested in to see the `Services
Overview` tab. This section contains your service's connection information, and
an overview of the configuration and resource usage for the service.

## Service users

By default, when you create a new service, a new `tsdbadmin` user is created.
This is the user that you use to connect to your new service.

The `tsdbadmin` user is the owner of the database, but is not a superuser. We
do not currently allow access to the `postgres` user, nor creation of multiple
databases. We recommend using schemas or creating additional services for data
isolation.

On Timescale Cloud services, the `tsdbadmin` user can create another user
with any other roles. For a complete list of roles available, see the
[PostgreSQL role attributes documentation][pg-roles-doc].
