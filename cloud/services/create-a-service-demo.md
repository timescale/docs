# Create a service with demo data

Timescale Cloud is a hosted, cloud-native TimescaleDB service that allows you to
quickly spin up new TimescaleDB instances. You can
[try Timescale Cloud for free][sign-up], no credit card required.

A good way to get started with your first service is to use our demo dataset.
Make sure you have created your [Timescale Cloud account][sign-up], and launch
your first service with the `Allmilk Factory` interactive demo to learn more
about how TimescaleDB works with your time series data.

For installation instructions, and help getting your first service up and
running, see the [Timescale Cloud installation section][cloud-install].

## Where to next

Now that you have your first service up and running, you can check out the
[Timescale Cloud][tsc-docs] section in our documentation, and
find out what you can do with it.

If you want to work through some tutorials to help you get up and running with
TimescaleDB and time-series data, check out our [tutorials][tutorials] section.
