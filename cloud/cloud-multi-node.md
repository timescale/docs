# Multi-node on Timescale Cloud
If you have a larger workload, you might need more than one TimescaleDB
instance. TimescaleDB multi-node allows you to run and manage multiple
instances, which can give you faster data ingest, and more responsive and
efficient queries for many large workloads.

This section shows you how to use multi-node on Timescale Cloud. You can also
use multi-node on [Managed Service for TimescaleDB][multinode-mst], or
[self-hosted TimescaleDB][multinode-timescaledb].

<highlight type="important">
In some cases, your processing speeds could be slower in a multi-node cluster,
because distributed hypertables need to push operations down to the various data
nodes. It is important that you understand multi-node architecture before you
begin, and plan your database according to your specific environment.

For more information about how multi-node works, see the
[multi-node on TimescaleDB][multinode-timescaledb] section.

## Set up multi-node on Timescale Cloud
To create a multi-node cluster, you need an access node that stores metadata
for the distributed hypertable and performs query planning across the cluster,
and any number of data nodes that store subsets of the distributed hypertable
dataset and run queries locally.

Before you begin, make sure you have [signed up][cloud-signup] for your
Timescale Cloud account.

### Setting up multi-node on Timescale Cloud
1.  [Log in to your Timescale Cloud account][cloud-login] and click
		`Create Service`.
1.  Go to the `Without demo data` tab to create the cluster without a data
		source. You can add your own data source later on. Click
		`Advanced options` to configure your service as a multi-node cluster.
1.  In the `Create a service` page, select the `multi-node` service type.
1.  Choose your preferred region, or accept the default region of `us-east-1`.
1.  Accept the default for the data nodes, or click `Change` to choose the
		number of data nodes, and their compute and disk size.
1.  Accept the default for the access node, or click `Change` to choose the
		compute and disk size.
1.  Click `Create service`. Take a note of the service information, you need
		these details to connect to your multi-node cluster. The service takes a
		few minutes to start up.
1.  When the service is ready, you can see the service in the Service Overview
		page. Click on the name of your new multi-node service to see more
		information, and to make changes.
