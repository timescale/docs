# Migrate your data to Timescale

You can migrate data from another database into Timescale using the PostgreSQL
`pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands. You can also use these tools to migrate
your data from Managed Service for TimescaleDB, from a self-hosted Timescale
instance, or from another PostgreSQL database, including Amazon RDS.

If you want to import data from another format, such as a `.csv` file, into a
new Timescale service, see the [data ingest section][data-ingest].
