# Project ownership

There must be one `owner` in a project at any given time. Project ownership grants you the ability to remove any member from the project.
<Procedure>

### Project ownership transfer

If you are the `owner` of a project, and have a [two-factor authentication][2fa] method enabled, you can 
transfer project ownership to another `member` of the project (losing your own ownership rights).

1.  [Log in to your Timescale account][cloud-login] and navigate to
    the `Members` section.
2.  Click the â‹® menu next to the person you want to transfer project ownership to. 
    If you are unable to transfer ownership at this time then hovering over the greyed out button should provide details.
3.  Enter your password, and click `Verify`.
4.  Complete the proposed two-factor authentication challenge and click `Confirm`.

If you don't have two-factor authentication or log in to Timescale using an [SAML authentication][saml] this option is unavailable.
Instead you can [reach out](https://www.timescale.com/contact) to have this action done.
