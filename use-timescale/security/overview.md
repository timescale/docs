# Timescale security

Timescale implements a variety of secure software engineering practices in TimescaleDB, including code static analysis 
for security hardening, automated scanning for dependency vulnerabilities, and code security reviews. 
Additionally, Timescale has developed the https://github.com/timescale/pgspot open-source extension that we 
use to identify security issues with Postgres extensions. This has helped tighten our security posture.
Timescale products do not have any identified weaknesses.

This page lists the additional things we do to ensure operational security and to lock-down Timescale Cloud services. 
To see our security features at a glance, see [Security at timescale][security-at-timescale].

## Data encryption

Your data on Timescale Cloud is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Both active
databases and backups are encrypted.

Timescale Cloud uses AWS as its cloud provider, with all the security that AWS
provides. Data encryption uses the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.
Cryptographic keys are managed by
[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)][aws-kms]. Keys are never stored in plaintext.

For more information about AWS security, see the AWS documentation on security
in [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud][ec2-security] and
[Elastic Block Storage][ebs-security].

## Networking security

Customer access to Timescale Cloud services is only provided over TLS-encrypted
connections. There is no option to use unencrypted plaintext connections.

## Networking with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering

When using VPC peering, **no public Internet-based access** is provided to the
services. Service addresses are published in public DNS, but they can only be
connected to from the customer's peered VPC using private network addresses.

VPC peering only enables communication to be initiated from your Customer VPC to 
Timescale Cloud services running in the Timescale VPC. Timescale cannot initiate 
communication with your VPC. To learn how to set up VPC Peering, see 
[Secure your Timescale Service with VPC Peering and AWS PrivateLink][vpc-peering].

## Operator access

Normally all the resources required for providing Timescale Cloud services are
automatically created, maintained and terminated by the Timescale
infrastructure. No manual operator intervention is required.

However, the Timescale Operations Team has the capability to securely
log in to the service Virtual Machines for troubleshooting purposes. These
accesses are audit logged.

No customer access to the virtual machine level is provided.

## Customer data privacy

Customer data privacy is of utmost importance at Timescale. By default, your
Timescale data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. To do this,
Timescale uses various technical mechanisms, processes, and software development
lifecycle practices, to help ensure the security and privacy of your data.

Timescale complies with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and all practices are covered by the
[Timescale Privacy Policy][timescale-privacy-policy]
and the [Timescale Terms of Service][tsc-tos]. All customer data is
processed in accordance with Timescale's GDPR-compliant
[Data Processor Addendum][tsc-data-processor-addendum],
which applies to all Timescale customers.

Timescale operators never access customer data, unless explicitly requested by
the customer to troubleshoot a technical issue. The Timescale operations team
has mandatory recurring training regarding the applicable policies.
