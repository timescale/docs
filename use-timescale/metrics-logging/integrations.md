# Integrate Timescale Cloud Services with third-party monitoring tools

You can export telemetry data from your Timescale Cloud _Time Series and Analytics_ services to third-party
monitoring tools such as [Datadog][datadog] or [AWS CloudWatch][cloudwatch]. Available metrics include
CPU usage, RAM usage, and storage. Third-party monitoring is available for [Scale or Enterprise][pricing-plan-features]
Timescale Projects.

This page shows you how to securely connect a data exporter to a monitoring tool, and manage
the lifecycle of data exporters.


## Securely connect Timescale Cloud Services to your third-party monitoring tool

To export telemetry data you:

1.  [Create a data exporter][create-exporter] - configure a Timescale Cloud data exporter to securely communicate with
    an external monitoring tool.
1.  [Attach the exporter to a Timescale Service][attach-exporter] - connect the exporter to a Timescale Cloud Service.


### Create a data exporter

A data exporter sends telemetry data from a Timescale Cloud Service to a third-party monitoring
tool. You attach each Timescale Cloud Service to a single data exporter. Each data exporter must be in the
same AWS region as the Timescale Cloud Service you are attaching it to. If your Timescale Cloud Project
has multiple services running in different regions, create an exporter for each region.

<Tabs label="Create a data exporter">

<Tab title="Datadog">

<Procedure>

1.  In Timescale Console, open [Integrations][console-integrations].
1.  Click `Create exporter`, click `Metrics`, then choose `Datadog`.

    src="https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tsc-integrations-datadog.webp"
    alt="Screenshot of the menu for adding a Datadog exporter" />

1.  Fill the UI with your Datadog configuration:

    - The AWS region must be the same for your Timescale Cloud exporter and the Datadog provider.
    - If you don't have an API key, [Create one][datadog-api-key].

1.  Set `Site` to your Datadog region, then click `Create exporter`.


</Procedure>

</Tab>

<Tab title="AWS CloudWatch">

<Procedure>

1.  In Timescale Console, open [Integrations][console-integrations].
1.  Click `Create exporter`, choose a data type, then click `AWS CloudWatch`.

    <img class="main-content__illustration"
    src="https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tsc-integrations-cloudwatch.png"
    alt="The UI to add an AWS CloudWatch exporter" />

1.  Fill the UI with your AWS CloudWatch configuration:

    - The AWS region must be the same for your Timescale Cloud exporter and AWS CloudWatch Log group.
    - The exporter name appears in Cloud console, best practice is to make this name easily understandable.
    - Enter your CloudWatch credentials:

    Either use an [existing CloudWatch Log group][console-cloudwatch-configuration]
    or [create a new one][console-cloudwatch-create-group]. If you're uncertain, use
    the default values. For more information, see [Working with log groups and log streams][cloudwatch-log-naming].

1.  Choose the authentication method to use for the exporter:

    <Tabs label="Authentication methods">
    
    <Tab title="IAM role">

    <Procedure>

    Timescale Cloud Services run in AWS. Best practice is to use [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)][irsa] to
    manage access between Timescale Cloud Services and your AWS resources.

    To create a role that securely communicates between Timescale Cloud Service and your AWS account:

    1. Create the IRSA role following this [AWS blog][cross-account-iam-roles].   
    
      When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you must: 
        - Set the URL to the [region where the exporter is being created][reference]. 
        - Add the role as a trusted entity.

      The following example shows a correctly configured IRSA role:

      **Permission Policy**:
      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "logs:PutLogEvents",
                   "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                   "logs:CreateLogStream",
                   "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                   "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                   "logs:PutRetentionPolicy",
                   "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                   "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                   "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                   "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                   "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries",
                   "ssm:GetParameters"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
      }      
      ```
      **Role with a Trust Policy**:
      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::12345678910:oidc-provider/irsa-oidc-discovery-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "irsa-oidc-discovery-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "Sid": "Statement1",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::12345678910:role/my-exporter-role"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
      }        
      ```      

    </Procedure>

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="CloudWatch credentials">

    <Procedure>

    When you use CloudWatch credentials, you link an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    user with access to CloudWatch only with your Timescale Cloud Service:

    1. Retrieve the user information from [IAM > Users in AWS console][list-iam-users].

       If you do not have an AWS user with access restricted to CloudWatch only,
       [create one][create-an-iam-user].
       For more information, see [Creating IAM users (console)][aws-access-keys].
    
    2. Enter the credentials for the AWS IAM user.

    <Highlight type="warning">
    AWS keys give access to your AWS services. To keep your AWS account secure,
    restrict users to the minimum required permissions. Always store your keys in a
    safe location. To avoid this issue, use the IAM role authentication method. 
    </Highlight>    

    </Procedure>

    </Tab>

    </Tabs> 

1. Select the AWS Region your CloudWatch services run in, then click `Create exporter`.

</Procedure>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Attach a data exporter to a Timescale Cloud Service

To send telemetry data to an external monitoring tool, you attach the data exporter to a 
Timescale Cloud Service. Each data exporter must be in the same AWS region as the Timescale Cloud Service you are
attaching it to.

Each Timescale Cloud Service has one exporter only. The exporter sends telemetry data from that
service to the monitoring provider.    

<Procedure>

1.  In [Timescale Portal > Services][services-portal], choose the service to monitor.
1.  Click `Operations`, then `Integrations`.
1.  Select an exporter, then click `Attach exporter`.

<Highlight type="warning">
You need to restart the Timescale Cloud Services when you attach a first `Logs` 
data type exporter.
</Highlight>

</Procedure>

## Monitor Timescale Cloud Service metrics

You can now monitor your service metrics from the [metrics explorer in
Datadog][datadog-metrics-explorer], or query them from the CloudWatch metrics
page in AWS Console. For more information, see the [Datadog][datadog-docs] or
[CloudWatch][cloudwatch-docs] documentation.

Use the following metrics to check the service is running correctly:

*   `timescale.cloud.system.cpu.usage.millicores`
*   `timescale.cloud.system.cpu.total.millicores`
*   `timescale.cloud.system.memory.usage.bytes`
*   `timescale.cloud.system.memory.total.bytes`
*   `timescale.cloud.system.disk.usage.bytes`
*   `timescale.cloud.system.disk.total.bytes`

Additionally, use the following tags to filter your results. 

|Tag|Example variable|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`host`|`us-east-1.timescale.cloud`||
|`project-id`|||
|`service-id`|||
|`region`|`us-east-1`|Timescale region|
|`role`|`replica` or `primary`|For services with replicas|
|`node-id`||For multi-node services|

## Edit a data exporter

To update a data exporter:

<Procedure>

1.  In Timescale Console, open [Integrations][console-integrations].
1.  Beside the exporter you want to edit, click the menu button. Click `Edit`.
1.  Edit the exporter fields and save your changes.

You cannot change fields such as the provider or the AWS region.

</Procedure>


## Delete a data exporter

To remove a data exporter that you no longer need:

<Procedure>

1. Disconnect the data exporter from your Timescale Cloud Services:

   For each Timescale Cloud Services the data exporter is connected to:
   1. In Timescale Console, open [Services][console-services], then select the Timescale Cloud Service to 
      update.
   1.  Click `Operations`, then click `Integrations`.
   1.  Click the trash can icon. 

   The data exporter is removed from this service. However, it still exists in your Timescale Cloud project.

1.  In Timescale Console, open [Integrations][console-integrations].
1.  Beside the exporter you want to delete, click the menu button, then click `Delete`.
1.  Confirm that you want to delete the data exporter.

</Procedure>

## Reference

When you create the IAM OIDC provider, the URL must match the region you create the exporter in.
It must be one of the following:

| Region           | Zone          | Location       | URL
|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| `ap-southeast-1` | Asia Pacific  | Singapore      | `irsa-oidc-discovery-prod-ap-southeast-1.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com`
