# Data tiering
Data Tiering provides a cost-effective way to store data that is rarely accessed and allows you to keep on scaling past the 16 TB limit. 

Your data is always there and can be [queried when needed][querying-tiered-data].

<!-- vale Google.SmartQuotes = NO -->

Data Tieringâ€™s focus on simplicity allows for seamless tiering through easy to set up policies;
no need to implement and maintain custom-built, bespoke solutions to offload data to secondary storage
or fetch it back in case they are needed for analysis.
And if you have or want to not keep very old data around, you can also add retention policies over tiered data as well.
