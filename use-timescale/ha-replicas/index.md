# High availability and replicas

You can use high availability and read replicas on your Timescale Cloud services
to significantly reduce the risk of downtime and data loss due to failures, and
to more effectively scale the limits of your service.

HA replicas in Timescale Cloud are exact, up-to-date copies of your database
that automatically take over operations if your primary becomes unavailable,
including during maintenance.

Read replicas can create an isolated environment to run heavy analytical
queries, so that you don't need to run them on a production instance, and risk
impacting performance.
