# User-defined actions

User-defined actions let you schedule custom-defined procedures to run within
TimescaleDB. They help you automate periodic tasks that aren't covered by
TimescaleDB's policy features.

In this section:

*   [Learn about user-defined actions][about-user-defined-actions] before you
    start using them
*   [Create and register][create-and-register] a user-defined action
*   [Test and debug][test-and-debug] a user-defined action
*   [Alter and delete][alter-and-delete] a user-defined action
*   Examples of user-defined actions:
    *   Use a user-defined action to set up a
        [generic data retention][generic-retention] policy that applies across
        all hypertables
    *   Use a user-defined action to implement
        [automatic moving of chunks between tablespaces][manage-storage]
    *   Use a user-defined action to automatically
        [downsample and compress][downsample-compress] older chunks
