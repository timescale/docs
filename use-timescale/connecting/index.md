# Connecting to Timescale

When you have your Timescale service up and running, you need a way to talk to
it from your local machine. Most of the instructions in the documentation use
`psql`, but that's not the only connection tool available to you. This section
gives instructions for installing `psql`, as well as some other common tools.

*   [Learn about connecting to your database][about-connecting] to understand
    how it works before you begin.
*   [Learn about using psql][about-psql].
*   Install [psql][connect-psql].
*   Install and use [Azure Data Studio][connect-azure].
*   Install and use [DBeaver][connect-dbeaver].
*   Install and use [pgAdmin][connect-pgadmin].

*   [Troubleshoot][connect-tshoot] connection issues.
