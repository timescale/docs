# Upgrade TimescaleDB

You can upgrade your on-premise TimescaleDB installation in-place.

A major upgrade is when you upgrade from one major version of TimescaleDB, to
the next major version. For example, when you upgrade from TimescaleDB&nbsp;1,
to TimescaleDB&nbsp;2.

A minor upgrade is when you upgrade within your current major version of
TimescaleDB. For example, when you upgrade from TimescaleDB&nbsp;2.5, to
TimescaleDB&nbsp;2.6.

If you originally installed TimescaleDB using Docker, you can upgrade from
within the Docker container. For more information, and instructions, see the
[Upgrading with Docker section][upgrade-docker].

You can also downgrade your TimescaleDB installation to a previous version, if
you need to.
