# Manage storage using tablespaces

If you are running Timescale on your own hardware, you can save storage
by moving chunks between tablespaces. By moving older chunks to cheaper, slower
storage, you can save on storage costs while still using faster, more expensive
storage for frequently accessed data. Moving infrequently accessed chunks can
also improve performance, because it isolates historical data from the continual
read-and-write workload of more recent data.

<Highlight type="note">
Using tablespaces is one way to manage data storage costs with Timescale. You
can also use [compression](/use-timescale/latest/compression) and
[data retention](/use-timescale/latest/data-retention) to reduce
your storage requirements.

## Move data

To move chunks to a new tablespace, you first need to create the new tablespace
and set the storage mount point. You can then use the
[`move_chunk`][api-move-chunk] API call to move individual chunks from the
default tablespace to the new tablespace. The `move_chunk` command also allows
you to move indexes belonging to those chunks to an appropriate tablespace.

Additionally, `move_chunk` allows you reorder the chunk during the migration.
This can be used to make your queries faster, and works in a similar way to the
[`reorder_chunk` command][api-reorder-chunk].

You must be logged in as a super user, such as the `postgres` user, to use the
`move_chunk()` API call.

<Procedure>

### Moving data

1.  Create a new tablespace. In this example, the tablespace is called
    `history`, it is owned by the `postgres` super user, and the mount point is
    `/mnt/history`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLESPACE history
    OWNER postgres
    LOCATION '/mnt/history';
    ```

1.  List chunks that you want to move. In this example, chunks that contain data
    that is older than two days:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions', older_than => INTERVAL '2 days');
    ```

1.  Move a chunk and its index to the new tablespace. You can also reorder the
    data in this step. In this example, the chunk called
    `_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk` is moved to the `history`
    tablespace, and is reordered based on its time index:

    ```sql
    SELECT move_chunk(
      chunk => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk',
      destination_tablespace => 'history',
      index_destination_tablespace => 'history',
      reorder_index => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk_netdata_time_idx',
      verbose => TRUE
    );
    ```

1.  You can verify that the chunk now resides in the correct tablespace by
    querying `pg_tables` to list all of the chunks on the tablespace:

    ```sql
    SELECT tablename from pg_tables
      WHERE tablespace = 'history' and tablename like '_hyper_%_%_chunk';
    ```

    You can also verify that the index is in the correct location:

    ```sql
    SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablespace = 'history';
    ```

</Procedure>

## Move data in bulk

To move several chunks at once, select the chunks you want to move by using
`FROM show_chunks(...)`. For example, to move chunks containing data between 1
and 3 weeks old, in a hypertable named `example`:

```sql
SELECT move_chunk(
  chunk => i,
  destination_tablespace => '<TABLESPACE>')
FROM show_chunks('example', now() - INTERVAL '1 week', now() - INTERVAL '3 weeks') i;
```

## Examples

After moving a chunk to a slower tablespace, you can move it back to the
default, faster tablespace:

```sql
SELECT move_chunk(
  chunk => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk',
  destination_tablespace => 'pg_default',
  index_destination_tablespace => 'pg_default',
  reorder_index => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk_netdata_time_idx'
);
```

You can move a data chunk to the slower tablespace, but keep the chunk's indexes
on the default, faster tablespace:

```sql
SELECT move_chunk(
  chunk => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk',
  destination_tablespace => 'history',
  index_destination_tablespace => 'pg_default',
  reorder_index => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk_netdata_time_idx'
);
```

You can also keep the data in `pg_default` but move the index to `history`.
Alternatively, you can set up a third tablespace called `history_indexes`,
and move the data to `history` and the indexes to `history_indexes`.

In Timescale&nbsp;2.0 and later, you can use `move_chunk` with the job scheduler
framework. For more information, see the [user-defined actions section][actions].
