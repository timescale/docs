# Install TimescaleDB from a Docker container

TimescaleDB is a [PostgreSQL extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/external-extensions.html) for
time series and demanding workloads that ingest and query high volumes of data. You can install a TimescaleDB 
instance on any local system, from a pre-built container. 

< Skip/>

This section shows you how to:

* [Install and configure TimescaleDB on PostgreSQL](#install-and-configure-timescaledb-on-postgresql) - set up
  a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance to efficiently run TimescaleDB1.
* [Add the TimescaleDB extension to your database](#add-the-timescaledb-extension-to-your-database) - enable TimescaleDB features and
  performance improvements on a database.

<Highlight type="warning">

If you have already installed PostgreSQL using a method other than the pre-built
container provided here, you may encounter errors
following these install instructions. Best practice is to full remove any existing PostgreSQL
installations before you begin.

To keep your current PostgreSQL installation, [Install from source][install-from-source].

### Prerequisites

To connect to a PostgreSQL installation on Docker, you need to install:

- [Docker][docker-install]
- [psql][install-psql]


## Install and configure TimescaleDB on PostgreSQL

Best practice for self-hosting TimescaleDB is to install the latest version of PostgreSQL and
TimescaleDB on a [supported platform](#supported-platforms) using the packages supplied by Timescale.

<SelfHostedDocker />


## Add the TimescaleDB extension to your database

For improved performance, you enable TimescaleDB on each database on your self-hosted PostgreSQL instance.
This section shows you how to enable TimescaleDB for a new database in PostgreSQL using `psql` from the command line.


<AddTimescaleDBToDB />

And that is, you have TimescaleDB running on a database on a self-hosted instance of PostgreSQL.

## More Docker options

The [TimescaleDB HA](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb-ha) Docker image 
includes [Ubuntu][ubuntu] as its operating system and offers the most complete TimescaleDB 
experience. It includes the [TimescaleDB Toolkit](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit),
and support for PostGIS and Patroni.  The lighter-weight TimescaleDB 
(non-HA) `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg14` image uses [Alpine][alpine]. 

<Highlight type="warning">
If your system uses Linux Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) for security rules, Docker could override your 
UFW port binding settings. Docker binds the container on Unix-based systems by modifying the Linux IP tables. 
If you are relying on UFW rules for network security, consider adding `DOCKER_OPTS="--iptables=false"`
to `/etc/default/docker` to prevent Docker from overwriting the IP tables. For more information about this 
vulnerability, see
[Docker's information about the UFW flaw](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fix-the-docker-and-ufw-security-flaw/).
</Highlight>

If you want to run the image directly from the container, you can use this
command:

```bash
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16
```

The `-p` flag binds the container port to the host port. This means that
anything that can access the host port can also access your TimescaleDB container,
so it's important that you set a PostgreSQL password using the
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable. Without that variable, the Docker
container disables password checks for all database users.

If you want to access the container from the host but avoid exposing it to the
outside world, you can bind to `127.0.0.1` instead of the public interface,
using this command:

```bash
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16
```

If you don't want to install `psql` and other PostgreSQL client tools locally,
or if you are using a Microsoft Windows host system, you can connect using the
version of `psql` that is bundled within the container with this command:

```bash
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres
```

Existing containers can be stopped using `docker stop` and started again with
`docker start` while retaining their volumes and data. When you create a new
container using the `docker run` command, by default you also create a new data
volume. When you remove a Docker container with `docker rm` the data volume
persists on disk until you explicitly delete it. You can use the `docker volume
ls` command to list existing docker volumes. If you want to store the data from
your Docker container in a host directory, or you want to run the Docker image
on top of an existing data directory, you can specify the directory to mount a
data volume using the `-v` flag.

<Highlight type="warning">
The two container types store PostgreSQL data dir in different places,
make sure you select the correct one to mount:

<!-- vale Vale.Terms = NO -->
|Container|PGDATA location|
|-|-|
`timescaledb-ha`|`/home/postgres/pgdata/data`
`timescaledb`| `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->
</Highlight>

```bash
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 \
-v /your/data/dir:/home/postgres/pgdata/data \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16
```

When you install TimescaleDB using a Docker container, the PostgreSQL settings
are inherited from the container. In most cases, you do not need to adjust them.
However, if you need to change a setting you can add `-c setting=value` to your
Docker `run` command. For more information, see the
[Docker documentation][docker-postgres].

The link provided in these instructions is for the latest version of TimescaleDB
on PostgreSQL 16. To find other Docker tags you can use, see the
[Dockerhub repository][dockerhub].


### View logs in Docker

If you have TimescaleDB installed in a Docker container, you can view your logs
using Docker, instead of looking in `/var/lib/logs` or `/var/logs`. For more
information, see the [Docker documentation on logs][docker-logs].
