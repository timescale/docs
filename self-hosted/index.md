# Self-hosted TimescaleDB

<TimescaleIntro />

The easiest way to discover and use Timescale for time-series is with Timescale
Cloud, which offers hosted high-performance PostgreSQL for time-series and
analytics.

However, if you want to run Timescale locally on your own hardware, you can
download the TimescaleDB PostgreSQL extension. For information about installing
self-hosted TimescaleDB, the
