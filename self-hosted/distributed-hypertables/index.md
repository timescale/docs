# Distributed hypertables

Distributed hypertables are hypertables that span multiple nodes. With
distributed hypertables, you can scale your data storage across multiple
machines and benefit from parallelized processing for some queries.

Many features of distributed hypertables work the same way as standard
hypertables. To learn how hypertables work in general, see the
[hypertables][hypertables] section.
