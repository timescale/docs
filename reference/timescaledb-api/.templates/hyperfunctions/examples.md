# Example 1

Extended examples that use multiple hyperfunctions from the group go here.

### Example 2

Each example should be preceded by a heading level 3 that briefly describes
what the example does.

## Some other section

If you need to add another freeform section to the end of the page, for example
some discussion about Advanced Usage or an algorithm explanation, put it down
here under a heading level 2. That ensures it shows up as a top-level section in
the Table of Contents.
