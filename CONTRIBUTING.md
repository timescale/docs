# Introduction
There are multiple ways to help make TimescaleDB better, including contributing
to the documentation. All of our documentation is available to use and review
with GitHub.

## First contribution
You can make contributions to the documentation by creating a fork of the
repository. However, if you have write access to the repository, use a branch
instead. Some of our automation does not work correctly on forks.

<procedure>

### Contributing using a fork
1.  Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and that you're signed in.
1.  Navigate to the
    [Timescale documentation repo](https://github.com/timescale/docs),
    click the `Fork` button in the top-right corner, and select the account you
    want to use.
2.  Wait for GitHub to create your fork and redirect you.
3.  Clone the repository to your local machine. To find this URL, click the green
    `Code` button and copy the HTTPS URL:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/docs.git
    ```
4.  List the current remote branches:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    This command should list two remotes, both marked `origin`, like this:
    ```bash
    origin  https://github.com/<username>/docs.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/<username>/docs.git (push)
    ```
    The `origin` remotes are your own fork, and you can do whatever you want here without changing the upstream repository.
5.  Add the docs repo as an upstream:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/timescale/docs.git
    ```
6.  Check:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    This command should now have the same two `origin` remotes as before, plus two more labelled `upstream`, like this:
    ```bash
    origin  https://github.com/<username>/docs.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/<username>/docs.git (push)
    upstream  https://github.com/timescale/docs.git (fetch)
    upstream  https://github.com/timescale/docs.git (push)
    ```
7.  Fetch the branches in the upstream repository:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```
8.  Merge the changes from the upstream `latest` branch, into your fork's
    `latest` branch:
    ```bash
    git merge upstream/latest
    ```
9.  Create a new branch for the work you want to do. Make sure you give it an
    appropriate name, and include your username:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b update-readme-username
    ```

</procedure>

### Committing changes and creating a pull request
1.  Make your changes.
1.  Add the updated files to your commit:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
1.  Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Commit message here"
    ```
1.  Push your changes:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    If git prompts you to set an upstream in order to push, use this command:
    ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>
    ```
1.  Create a pull request (PR) by navigating to
    <https://github.com/timescale/docs> and clicking
    `Compare and Create Pull Request`. Write an informative commit message
    detailing your changes, choose reviewers, and save your PR. If you haven't
    yet finished the work you want to do, make sure you create a draft PR by
    selecting it from the drop down box in the GitHub web UI. This lets your
    reviewers know that you haven't finished work yet, while still being
    transparent about what you are working on, and making sure we all understand
    current progress.

</procedure>

<highlight type="important">
Choose your reviewers carefully! If you have made changes to the technical
detail of the documentation, choose an appropriate subject matter expert (SME)
to review those changes. Additionally, every change requires at least one
documentation team member to approve. Ask the documentation team for a review by
adding the `timescale/documentation` group as a reviewer.
</highlight>

## Second contribution
When you have checked out the repo, if you want to keep working on things, you
need to make sure that your local copy of the repo stays up to date. If you
don't do this, you *will* end up with merge conflicts.

<procedure>

### Second contribution
1.  Check out your fork's `latest` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout latest
    ```
    You get a message like this:
    ```bash
    Switched to branch 'latest'
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/latest'.
    ```
    BEWARE! This is usually a lie!
1.  Fetch the branches in the upstream repository:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```
1.  Merge the changes from the upstream `latest` branch, into your fork's
    `latest` branch:
    ```bash
    git merge upstream/latest
    ```
1.  If you are continuing work you began earlier, check out the branch that
    contains your work. For new work, create a new branch. Doing this regularly
    as you are working means you keep your local copies up to date and avoid
    conflicts. You should do it at least every day before you begin work, and
    again whenever you switch branches.


</procedure>

<highlight type="warning">
Never leave branches lying around on your local system. Create your PR as soon
as possible, and make good use of the Draft feature. Commit to your feature
branch early and often! Update your local copy from latest whenever you switch
branches.
</highlight>

## Reviewing standards
When you create a pull request, a member of the documentation team will review
it for accuracy and adherance to our standards. You can see a list of the things
that reviewers check for in the pull request template.

## Writing standards
Timescale has comprehensive writing and style standards, that are constantly
being updated and improved. For the current guidelines, see
[contributing to documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/contribute-to-docs/).
