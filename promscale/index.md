# Promscale
Promscale is the open source observability backend for metrics and traces
powered by SQL.

It is built on top of PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB. Promscale supports Prometheus metrics and is 100% compliant with PromQL and OpenTelemetry traces.
Its full SQL capabilities enable developers to correlate metrics, traces, and business data to get valuable insights.
This is not possible when data is siloed in different systems.
