# Query metric data with SQL
This section covers information about the different SQL queries you can use for
metric data. 

You can query the data in Promscale with your preferred SQL tool. For example,
you can use `psql`.
For more information about installing and using `psql`, see the
[installing psql section][install-psql].

## Metric views

When you query a metric, the query is performed against the view
of the metric you're interested in. The name of the view is the metric name.

For example, to query a metric named `go_dc_duration_seconds` for its samples in the
past five minutes: 

```sql
SELECT * from go_gc_duration_seconds
WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```
This metric measures for how long garbage collection takes in
Go applications.

The output is similar to:

```sql
|           time             |    value    | series_id |      labels       | instance_id | job_id | quantile_id |
|----------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 2021-01-27 18:43:42.389+00 |           0 |       495 | {208,43,51,212}   |          43 |     51 |         212 |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:42.389+00 |           0 |       497 | {208,43,51,213}   |          43 |     51 |         213 |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:42.389+00 |           0 |       498 | {208,43,51,214}   |          43 |     51 |         214 |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:42.389+00 |           0 |       499 | {208,43,51,215}   |          43 |     51 |         215 |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:42.389+00 |           0 |       500 | {208,43,51,216}   |          43 |     51 |         216 |
```

In this output:

* The `series_id` uniquely identifies the measurements label set. This enables
  efficient aggregation by series.
* The `labels` field contains an array of foreign keys to label key-value pairs
  that make up the label set.
* The `<LABEL_KEY>_id` fields are separate fields for each label key in the
  label set, to simplify access.

## Query values for label keys
Each label key is expanded into its own column, which stores foreign key
identifiers to their value. This allows you to `JOIN`, aggregate, and filter by
label keys and values.

To retrieve the text represented by a label ID, you can use the `val(field_id)`
function. This allows you to do things like aggregation across all series with a
particular label key.

For example, to find the median value for the `go_gc_duration_seconds` metric,
grouped by the job associated with it:

```sql
SELECT
    val(job_id) as job,
    percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by value) AS median
FROM
    go_gc_duration_seconds
WHERE
    time > now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
GROUP BY job_id;
```

The output is similar to:

```sql
|      job      |  median   |
|---------------|---------- |
| prometheus    |  6.01e-05 |
| node-exporter | 0.0002631 |
```

## Query label sets for a metric
The `labels` field in any metric row represents the full set of labels
associated with the measurement. It is represented as an array of identifiers.
To return the entire label set in JSON, you can use the `jsonb()` function:

```sql
SELECT
    time, value, jsonb(labels) as labels
FROM
    go_gc_duration_seconds
WHERE
    time > now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

The output is similar to:

```sql
|            time            |    value    |                                                        labels                                                       |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2021-01-27 18:43:48.236+00 | 0.000275625 | {"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.5"}        |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:48.236+00 | 0.000165632 | {"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.25"}       |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:48.236+00 | 0.000320684 | {"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.75"}       |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:52.389+00 |  1.9633e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0"}   |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:52.389+00 |  1.9633e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "1"}   |
| 2021-01-27 18:43:52.389+00 |  1.9633e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0.5"} |
```

This query returns the label set for the metric `go_gc_duration` in JSON format,
so you can read or further interact with it.

## Filter by labels
You can filter by labels, because matching operators correspond to the selectors
in PromQL. The operators are used in a `WHERE` clause, in the
`labels ? (<label_key> <operator> <pattern>)`.

The four matching operators are:

|Operator|Description|
|-|-|
|`==`|Matches tag values that are equal to the pattern|
|`!==`|Matches tag values that are not equal to the pattern|
|`==~`|Matches tag values that match the pattern regex|
|`!=~`|Matches tag values that are not equal to the pattern regex|

Each operator corresponds to a selector in PromQL, although they have slightly
different spellings to avoid clashing with other PostgreSQL operators. You can
combine them using any Boolean logic, with any arbitrary `WHERE` clauses. For
example, if you want only metrics from the job called `node-exporter`, you can
filter by labels like this:

```sql
SELECT
    time, value, jsonb(labels) as labels
FROM
    go_gc_duration_seconds
WHERE
    labels ? ('job' == 'node-exporter')
    AND time > now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

The output is similar to:
```sql
| time                       |   value   |              labels                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2021-01-28 02:01:18.066+00 |  3.05e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0"}|
| 2021-01-28 02:01:28.066+00 |  3.05e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0"}|
|2021-01-28 02:01:38.032+00  |  3.05e-05 | {"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0"}|
```

## Query examples

SQL provides powerful capabilities to analyze metric data in many different ways.
This sections provides a number of different examples to illustrate how you can
use SQL to do more sophisticated analysis on your metric data.

### Query the number of data points in a series
Each row in a metric's view has a `series_id` that uniquely identifies the
measurement's label set. This allows you to aggregate by series more
efficiently. You can retrieve the labels array from a `series_id` using the
`labels(series_id)` function. For example, this query shows how many data points
we have in each series:

```sql
SELECT jsonb(labels(series_id)) as labels, count(*)
FROM go_gc_duration_seconds
GROUP BY series_id;
```

The output is similar to:
```sql
|                                                       labels                                                        | count |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
|{"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0.75"} |   631 |
|{"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.75"}        |   631 |
|{"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "1"}    |   631 |
|{"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0.5"}  |   631 |
|{"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.5"}         |   631 |
|{"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0"}    |   631 |
|{"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "1"}           |   631 |
|{"job": "node-exporter", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "node_exporter:9100", "quantile": "0.25"} |   631 |
|{"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0.25"}        |   631 |
|{"job": "prometheus", "__name__": "go_gc_duration_seconds", "instance": "localhost:9090", "quantile": "0"}           |   631 |
```

### Query percentiles aggregated over time and series
This query calculates the ninety-ninth percentile over both time and series
(`app_id`) for the metric named `go_gc_duration_seconds`. This metric is a
measurement for how long garbage collection is taking in Go applications:

```sql
SELECT
    val(instance_id) as app,
    percentile_cont(0.99) within group(order by value) p99
FROM
    go_gc_duration_seconds
WHERE
    value != 'NaN' AND val(quantile_id) = '1' AND instance_id > 0
GROUP BY instance_id
ORDER BY p99 desc;
```

An example of the output for this query:
```sql
|       app         |     p99      |
|-------------------|------------  |
|node_exporter:9100 | 0.002790063  |
|localhost:9090     |  0.00097977  |
```

This query is unique to Promscale, as it aggregates over both time and series
and returns an accurate calculation of the percentile. It is not possible to use
PromQL alone to accurately calculate percentiles when aggregating over both time
and series.

### A complex example: identifying over-provisioned containers
The example in this section queries metrics from Prometheus and the
`node_exporter` to identify Kubernetes containers that are over-provisioned.
In this query, you find containers whose ninety-ninth percentile memory
utilization is low, like this:

```sql
WITH memory_allowed as (
  SELECT
    labels(series_id) as labels,
    value,
    min(time) start_time,
    max(time) as end_time
  FROM container_spec_memory_limit_bytes total
  WHERE value != 0 and value != 'NaN'
  GROUP BY series_id, value
)
SELECT
  val(memory_used.container_id) container,
  percentile_cont(0.99)
    within group(order by memory_used.value/memory_allowed.value)
    AS percent_used_p99,
  max(memory_allowed.value) max_memory_allowed
FROM container_memory_working_set_bytes AS memory_used
INNER JOIN memory_allowed
      ON (memory_used.time >= memory_allowed.start_time AND
          memory_used.time <= memory_allowed.end_time AND
          eq(memory_used.labels,memory_allowed.labels))
WHERE memory_used.value != 'NaN'
GROUP BY container
ORDER BY percent_used_p99 ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

An example of the output for this query:

```sql
| container                      |   percent_used_p99      |  total      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| cluster-overprovisioner-system |   6.961822509765625e-05 | 4294967296  |
| sealed-secrets-controller      |   0.00790748596191406   | 1073741824  |
| dumpster                       |   0.0135690307617187    |  268435456  |
```

This example uses `cAdvisor`, as an example of the sorts of sophisticated
analysis enabled by Promscale's support to query your data in SQL.
