# Visualize Promscale traces in Jaeger
Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing system used for monitoring and 
troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. To visualize traces 
stored in Promscale in Jaeger, you need to have the `jaeger-query` component 
running. This Jaeger component queries and visualizes traces from Promscale. 

This section shows you how to integrate [Jaeger][jaeger-ui] with Promscale.

Before you begin, deploy the `jaeger-query` component from the Jaeger 
[deployments page][jaeger-deployments]. Ensure that you are using `jaeger-query`
version 1.30 or later. 

<procedure>

## Connecting Jaeger Query with Promscale
    
1.  Configure the `SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE`, and `GRPC_STORAGE_SERVER` options for `jaeger-query` using the environment variables: 
    ```
    SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=grpc-plugin
    GRPC_STORAGE_SERVER=<PROMSCALE_HOST>:9202
    ```
    where: `<PROMSCALE_HOST>:9202` is the Promscale gRPC endpoint.

1.  Start the `jaeger-query` component, it should be successfully connected with
    Promscale to visualize the traces. 

</procedure>

You can visualize traces from Promscale in `jaeger-query` home page. Use the
`Search` panel on the left to filter and query traces from Promscale.

## Use Docker for setting up Jaeger Query with Promscale

To set up `jaeger-query` with Promscale using Docker you need the IP address of the Promscale container or the URL. 

You can find the IP address of the Promscale container using:
```bash
docker inspect <PROMSCALE_CONTAINER_NAME>
```
In the output, the IP address is listed under `NetworkSettings` → `Networks` → `IPAddress` section.

You can set the URL as `<PROMSCALE>:9202` where:
- `9202` is the gRPC endpoint of Promscale
- `<PROMSCALE>` is the name of the container

<procedure>

### Connecting Promscale and a Jaeger query
1.  Run Jaeger query using the [official Docker image][jaeger-docker]:
    ``` bash
    docker run -d \
      -p 16686:16686 \
      --network opentelemetry-demo_default \
      --name=jaeger \
      -e "SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=grpc-plugin" -e "GRPC_STORAGE_SERVER=<PROMSCALE>:9202" \
      jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.30
    ```
1.  Navigate to `localhost:16686` in your browser, to access the `jaeger-query` homepage.

1.  Use the `Search` panel on the left to filter and start querying traces from
    Promscale.
