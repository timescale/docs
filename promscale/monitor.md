# Monitor Promscale
Promscale includes a set of out-of-the-box alerts, runbooks, and a Grafana
dashboard that you can use to monitor it.

<highlight type="note"> To monitor Promscale, make sure that a Prometheus
instance is scraping the Promscale HTTP metrics endpoint, which defaults to port `9201`
port in the `/metrics` API. Use Prometheus to evaluate the Promscale alerting
rules, and configure Prometheus as a data source in Grafana to visualize the
Promscale dashboard. This helps to troubleshoot issues when Promscale isn't
working as expected. You should be using a separate Prometheus instance and not Promscale.
You don't want your monitoring tool monitoring itself.

## Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard consists of Promscale metrics grouped in several rows:
* Overview
* Ingest
* Query
* Database
* Cache

## Alerts

You can configure alerting rules for Promscale to send alerts when something
doesn't work as expected in Promscale.

[Here][promscale-alerting-rules] are the alerting rules for Promscale. These
alerting rules should be configured on the Prometheus instance that you
are using to monitor Promscale.

## Runbooks

When an alert is sent, the alert message references the relevant runbook to
troubleshoot and mitigate the issue. These runbooks are published and maintained
in the [Promscale Github repository][promscale-runbooks].
