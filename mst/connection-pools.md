# Connection pools

When you connect to your database, you consume server resources. If you have a
lot of connections to your database, you can consume a lot of server resources.
One way to mitigate this is to use connection pooling, which allows you to have
high numbers of connections, but keep your server resource use low. The more
client connections you have to your database, the more useful connection pooling
becomes.

By default, PostgreSQL creates a separate backend process for each connection to
the server. Connection pooling uses a tool called PGBouncer to pool multiple
connections to a single backend process. PGBouncer automatically interleaves the
client queries to use a limited number of backend connections more efficiently,
leading to lower resource use on the server and better total performance.

Without connection pooling, the database connections are handled directly by
PostgreSQL backend processes, one process per connection:

When you add connection pooling, fewer backend connections are required. This
frees up server resources for other tasks, such as disk caching:

Connection pooling allows you to handle up to 5000 database client connections
simultaneously. You can calculate how many connections you can handle by the
number of CPU cores you have available. You should have at least one connection
per core, but make sure you are not overloading each core. A good number of
connections to aim for is three to five times the available CPU cores, depending
on your workload.

## Connection pooling modes

There are several different pool modes:

*   Transaction (default)
*   Session
*   Statement

### Transaction pooling mode

This is the default pooling mode. It allows each client connection to take turns
using a backend connection during a single transaction. When the transaction is
committed, the backend connection is returned back into the pool and the next
waiting client connection reuses the same connection immediately. This provides
quick response times for queries as long as the most transactions are performed
quickly. This is the most commonly used mode.

### Session pooling mode

This mode holds a client connection until the client disconnects. When the
client disconnects, the server connection is returned back into the connection
pool free connection list, to wait for the next client connection. Client
connections are accepted at TCP level, but their queries only proceed when
another client disconnects and frees up the backend connection back into the
pool. This mode is useful when you require a wait queue for incoming
connections, while keeping the server memory usage low. However, it is not
useful in most common scenarios because the backend connections are recycled
very slowly.

### Statement pooling mode

This mode is similar to the transaction pool mode, except that instead of
allowing a full transaction to be run, it cycles the server side connections
after each and every database statement (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, for
example). Transactions containing multiple SQL statements are not allowed in
this mode. This mode is best suited to specialized workloads that use sharding
front-end proxies.

## Set up a connection pool

You can set up a connection pool from the Managed Service for TimescaleDB
portal. Make sure you have already created a service that you want to add
connection pooling to.

<Procedure>

### Setting up a connection pool

1.  In the MST portal, navigate to the
    `Services` list, and click the name of the service you want to add connection pooling to.
1.  In the `Service overview` page, navigate to the `Pools` tab. When you have
    created some pools, they are shown here.
1.  Click `Add Pool` to create a new pool.
1.  In the `Create New Connection Pool` dialog, use these settings:
    *   In the `Pool name` field, type a name for your new pool. This name
        becomes the database `dbname` connection parameter for your pooled
        client connectons.
    *   In the `Database` field, select a database to connect to. Each pool can
        only connect to one database.
    *   In the `Pool Mode` field, select which
        [pool mode](#connection-pooling-modes) to use.
    *   In the `Pool Size` field, select the maximum number of server
        connections this pool can use at any one time.
    *   In the `Username` field, select which database username to connect to
        the database with.
1.  Click `Create` to create the pool, and see the details of the new pool in
    the list. You can click `Info` next to the pool details to see more
    information, including the URI and port details.

Pooled servers use a different port number than regular servers. This allows you
to use both pooled and un-pooled connections at the same time.
