### Configure Aiven Client to connect to Managed Service for TimescaleDB

To access Managed Service for TimescaleDB with the Aiven Client, you need an authentication token. Aiven Client uses this to access your services on Managed Service for TimescaleDB.

<Procedure>

#### Configuring Aiven Client to connect to Managed Service for TimescaleDB

1.  Change to the install directory that contains the configuration files:

    ```bash
    cd ~/.config/aiven/
    ```

1.  Open the `aiven-credentials.json` using any editor and update these lines with your Managed Service for TimescaleDB `User email`, and the
    `authentication token` that you generated :

    ```bash
    {
      "auth_token": "ABC1+123...TOKEN==",
      "user_email": "your.email@timescale.com"
    }
    ```

1.  Save the `aiven-credentials.json` file.

1.  To verify that you can access your services on Managed Service for TimescaleDB, type:

    ```bash
    avn project list
    ```

    This command shows a list of all your projects:

    ```bash
     PROJECT_NAME       DEFAULT_CLOUD            CREDIT_CARD
     =============     =======================   ===================
     project-xxxx      timescale-aws-us-east-1   xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
     project-yyyy      timescale-aws-us-east-1   xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
     project-zzzz      timescale-aws-us-east-1   xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
    ```

</Procedure>

## Fork services with Aiven client

When you a fork a service, you create an exact copy of the service, including
the underlying database. You can use a fork of your service to:

*   Create a development copy of your production environment.
*   Set up a snapshot to analyze an issue or test an upgrade.
*   Create an instance in a different cloud, geographical location, or under
    a different plan.

For more information about projects, plans, and other details about
services,see [Services][about-mst].

<Procedure>

### Creating a fork of your service

1.  In the Aiven client, connect to your
    [Managed Service for TimescaleDB service][Install and configure the Aiven client].

2.  Switch to the project that contains the service you want to fork:

    ```bash
     avn project switch <PROJECT>
    ```

3.  List the services in the project, and make a note of the service that you want to fork, listed under `SERVICE_NAME` column in the output.

    ```bash
     avn service list
    ```

4.  Get the details of the service that you want to fork:

    ```bash
    avn service get <SERVICE_NAME>
    ```

5.  Create the fork:

    ```bash
    avn service create <NAME_OF_FORK> --project <PROJECT_ID>\
    -t <SERVICE_TYPE> --plan <PLAN> --cloud <CLOUD_NAME>\
    -c service_to_fork_from=<NAME_OF_SERVICE_TO_FORK>
    ```

</Procedure>

### Example

To create a fork named `grafana-fork` for a service named `grafana` with these parameters:

*   PROJECT_ID: `project-fork`
*   CLOUD_NAME: `timescale-aws-us-east-1`
*   PLAN_TYPE: `dashboard-1`

```bash
   avn service create grafana-fork --project project-fork -t grafana --plan dashboard-1 --cloud timescale-aws-us-east-1  -c service_to_fork_from=grafana
```

You can switch to `project-fork` and view the newly created `grafana-fork` using:

```bash
   avn service list
```

## Configure Grafana authentication plugins

Grafana supports multiple authentication plugins, in addition to built-in username and password authentication.

On Managed Service for TimescaleDB, Grafana supports Google, GitHub, and GitLab authentication. You can configure authentication integration using the Aiven command-line client.

2.  Switch to the project that contains the Grafana service you want to integrate:

    ```bash
     avn project switch <PROJECT>
    ```

3.  List the services in the project. Note the Grafana service that you want to configure, listed under `SERVICE_NAME` column in the
    output.

    ```bash
     avn service list
    ```

4.  Get the details of the service that you want to integrate:

    ```bash
    avn service get <SERVICE_NAME>
    ```

5.  Configure the Grafana service using the SMTP values:

    ```bash
       avn service update --project <PROJECT> <SERVICE_NAME>\
       -c smtp_server.host=smtp.example.com \
       -c smtp_server.port=465 \
       -c smtp_server.username=emailsenderuser \
       -c smtp_server.password=emailsenderpass \
       -c smtp_server.from_address="grafana@yourcompany.com"
    ```

6.  [](#)<Optional /> Review all available custom options, and configure:

    ```bash
       avn service types -v
    ```

You can now send emails for your Grafana service on MST.

</Procedure>

## Create a read-only replica with Aiven client

Read-only replicas enable you to perform read-only queries against the replica and reduce the load on the primary server. They are also a
good way to optimize query response times across different geographical locations. You can achieve this by placing the replicas in different regions or even different cloud providers.

<Procedure>

### Creating a read-only replica of your service

1.  In the Aiven client, connect to your [Managed Service for TimescaleDB service][Install and configure the Aiven client].

2.  Switch to the project that contains the TimescaleDB service you want to create a read-only replica for:

    ```bash
    avn project switch <PROJECT>
    ```

3.  List the services in the project. Note the service for which you will create a read-only replica. You can find it listed under the `SERVICE_NAME` column in the output:

    ```bash
    avn service list
    ```

4.  Get the details of the service that you want to fork:

    ```bash
    avn service get <SERVICE_NAME>
    ```

5.  Create a read-only replica:

    ```bash
    avn service create <NAME_OF_REPLICA> --project <PROJECT_ID>\
    -t pg --plan <PLAN_TYPE> --cloud timescale-aws-us-east-1\
    -c pg_read_replica=true\
    -c service_to_fork_from=<NAME_OF_SERVICE_TO_FORK>\
    -c pg_version=11 -c variant=timescale
    ```

</Procedure>

### Example

To create a fork named `replica-fork` for a service named `timescaledb` with
these parameters:

*   PROJECT_ID: `fork-project`
*   CLOUD_NAME: `timescale-aws-us-east-1`
*   PLAN_TYPE: `timescale-basic-100-compute-optimized`

```bash
avn service create replica-fork --project fork-project\
-t pg --plan timescale-basic-100-compute-optimized\
--cloud timescale-aws-us-east-1 -c pg_read_replica=true\
-c service_to_fork_from=timescaledb -c\
pg_version=11 -c variant=timescale
```

You can switch to `project-fork` and view the newly created `replica-fork` using:

```bash
avn service list
```
