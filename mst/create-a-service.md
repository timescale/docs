# About services

A managed TimescaleDB service is an instance that corresponds to a cloud service
provider tier. You can access all your services from the `Services` tab within
your projects. Before you begin, make sure you have
[signed up to Managed Service for TimescaleDB][sign-up] and created your account.

For installation instructions, and help getting your first service up and
running, see the
[Managed Service for Timescale installation section][mst-install].

When you have created, and named, a new Managed Service for TimescaleDB service,
you cannot rename it. If you need to have your service running under a different
name, you need to create a new service, and manually migrate the data. For more
information about migrating data, see [migrating your data][migrate-data-mst].

Now you have your service up and running, you can try your
[first tutorial][getting-started].
