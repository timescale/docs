# Managed Service for TimescaleDB

Managed Service for TimescaleDB provides a fully managed TimescaleDB service
hosted in more than 75 regions using AWS, Azure, or GCP. You can use this
service to create database instances, or services, in the cloud and automate
most of your most common operational tasks. This allows you to spend more time
focusing on your time-series workloads and less time worrying about database
management.
