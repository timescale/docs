# Migrate the entire database to Managed Service for TimescaleDB

You can migrate your data from self-hosted Timescale to Managed Service for
TimescaleDB and automate most of your most common operational tasks.

Managed Service for TimescaleDB creates a database named `defaultdb` and a
default user account named `tsdbadmin`. You can use the Web console to create
additional users and databases using the `Users` and `Databases` tabs.

You can switch between different plan sizes in Managed Service for TimescaleDB,
However, during the dumping process choose a plan size that has the same
storage size or slightly larger than the currently allocated plan. This allows
you to limit the downtime during the migration process and have a sufficiently
powerful Timescale plan.

<Highlight type="warning">
Depending on your database size and network speed, migration can take a very
long time. During this time, any new writes that happen during the dumping
process are not included. To prevent data loss, turn off all the
writes to the old database server before you start the dumping process. Try to
migrate as a cold run without turning off writes on your previous server and
running the dump concurrently. This gives you an estimate of the time the dump
process takes. It also helps you in practicing the actual operation when it's
not causing downtime to your customers.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have:

*   Installed the PostgreSQL [`pg_dump`][pg_dump] and [`pg_restore`][pg_restore]
    utilities.
*   Installed a client for connecting to PostgreSQL. These instructions use
    [`psql`][psql], but any client works.
*   Created a new empty database in Managed Service for TimescaleDB. For more
    information, see the [Install Managed Service for TimescaleDB][install-mst].
    Provision your database with enough space for all your data.
*   Checked that you're running the same major version of PostgreSQL on both
    Managed Service for TimescaleDB and your source database. For information
    about upgrading PostgreSQL, see the [upgrade
    instructions for self-hosted TimescaleDB][upgrading-postgresql-self-hosted]
    and [Managed Service for TimescaleDB][upgrading-postgresql].
*   Checked that you're running the same major version of TimescaleDB on both
    Managed Service for TimescaleDB and your source database. For more
    information, see the [upgrading Timescale section][upgrading-timescaledb].

<Highlight type="note">
To speed up migration, compress your data. You can compress any chunks where
data is not currently inserted, updated, or deleted. When you finish the
migration, you can decompress chunks as needed for normal operation. For more
information about compression and decompression, see the
[compression section](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/compression/).

<Procedure>

### Migrating the database

1.  Dump all the data from your source database into a `dump.bak` file, using
    your source database connection details. If you are prompted for a password,
    use your source database credentials, and to avoid permissions errors,
    include the `--no-owner` flag:

    ```bash
    pg_dump -U <SOURCE_DB_USERNAME> -W \
    -h <SOURCE_DB_HOST> -p <SOURCE_DB_PORT> --no-owner -Fc -v \
    -f dump.bak <SOURCE_DB_NAME>
    ```

1.  At the command prompt, restore the dumped data from the `dump.bak` file into
    your Managed Service for TimescaleDB database, using your Managed Service
    for TimescaleDB connection details. To migrate from multiple databases you
    repeat the process of dumping or loading one database after another. The
    `--jobs`  option specifies the number of CPUs to use to dump and restore the
    database concurrently.

    ```bash
    pg_restore -d 'postgres://CLICK_TO:REVEAL_PASSWORD@demo.demoproject.timescaledb.io:19335/defaultdb?sslmode=require' --jobs 4 dump.bak
    ```

1.  Connect to your new database and update your table statistics by running
    [`ANALYZE`]   [analyze] on your entire dataset:

    ```sql
    psql 'postgres://CLICK_TO:REVEAL_PASSWORD@demo.demoproject.timescaledb.io:19335/defaultdb?sslmode=require'
    defaultdb=> ANALYZE;
    ```

</Procedure>

## Troubleshooting

If you see these errors during the migration process, you can safely ignore
them. The migration still occurs successfully.

1.  Error when using `pg_dump`:

    ```bash
    pg_dump: warning: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:
    pg_dump: hypertable
    pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
    pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
    pg_dump: NOTICE:  hypertable data are in the chunks, no data will be copied
    DETAIL:  Data for hypertables are stored in the chunks of a hypertable so COPY TO of a hypertable will not copy any data.
    HINT:  Use "COPY (SELECT * FROM <hypertable>) TO ..." to copy all data in hypertable, or copy each chunk individually.
    ```

1.  Error when using `pg_restore:

   ```bash
   pg_restore: while PROCESSING TOC:
   pg_restore: from TOC entry 4142; 0 0 COMMENT EXTENSION timescaledb
   pg_restore: error: could not execute query: ERROR:  must be owner of extension timescaledb
   Command was: COMMENT ON EXTENSION timescaledb IS 'Enables scalable inserts and complex queries for time-series data';
