# About Managed Service for TimescaleDB

<MSTIntro />

<CloudMSTComparison />

Your Managed Service for TimescaleDB account has three main components:
projects, services, and databases.

Before you begin, make sure you have
[signed up to Managed Service for TimescaleDB][sign-up] and created your account.

## Projects

When you sign up for Managed Service for TimescaleDB, an empty project is
created for you automatically. Projects are the highest organization level, and
they contain all your services and databases. You can use projects to organize
groups of services. Each project can also have its own billing settings.

To create a new project, click the project name in the navigation menu, and
click `Create a new project`.

## Services

Each project contains one or more services. You can have multiple services under
each project, and each service corresponds to a cloud service provider tier. You
can access all your services from the `Services` tab within your projects.

For more information about getting your first service up and running, see the
[Managed Service for Timescale installation section][mst-install].

<highlight type="important">
When you have created, and named, a new Managed Service for TimescaleDB service,
you cannot rename it. If you need to have your service running under a different
name, you need to create a new service, and manually migrate the data. For more
information about migrating data, see
[migrating your data](https://docs.timescale.com/mst/latest/migrate-to-mst/).
</highlight>

For information about billing on Managed Service for TimescaleDB, see the
[billing section][mst-billing].

## Databases

Each service can contain one or more databases. To view existing databases, or
to create a new database, click the name of the service in the services list,
and navigate to the `Databases` tab.

## Service level agreement

Managed Service for TimescaleDB is provided through a partnership with Aiven.
This provides you with a service commitment to deliver 99.99% availability. For
more information, see the
[Aiven Service Level Agreement policy][aiven-sla].

## Service configuration plans

When you create a new service, you need to select a configuration plan. The plan
determines the number of VMs the service runs in, the high availability
configuration, the number of CPU cores, and size of RAM and storage volumes.

The plans are:

*   Basic Plans: include 2 days of backups and automatic backup and restore if
    your instance fails.
*   Dev Plans: include 1 day of backups and automatic backup and restore if your
    instance fails.
*   Pro Plans: include 3 days of backups and automatic failover to a hot standby
    if your instance fails.

The Basic and Dev plans are serviced by a single virtual machine (VM) node. This
means that if the node fails, the service is unavailable until a new VM is
built. This can result in data loss, if some of the latest changes to the data
weren't backed up before the failure. Sometimes, it can also take a long time to
return the service back to normal operation, because a new VM needs to be
created and restored from backups before the service can resume. The time to
recover depends on the amount of data you have to restore.

The Pro plans are much more resilient to failures. A single node failure causes
no data loss, and the possible downtime is minimal. If an acting TimescaleDB
master node fails, an up-to-date replica node is automatically promoted to
become the new master. This means there is only a small outage while
applications reconnect to the database and access the new master.

You can upgrade your plan while the service is running. The service is
reconfigured to run on larger VMs in the background and when the reconfiguration
is complete, the DNS names are pointed to the new hosts. This can cause a short
disruption to your service while DNS changes are propagated.

Within each configuration plan option, there are several plan types available:

*   `IO-Optimized` and `Compute-Optimized` These configurations are optimized
    for input/output (I/O) performance, using SSD storage media.
*   `Storage-Optimized`: These configurations usually have larger amounts of
    overall storage, using HDD storage media.
*   `Dev-Only`: These configurations are typically smaller footprints, and lower
    cost, designed for development and testing scenarios.

## High availability

Most minor failures are handled automatically without making any changes to your
service deployment. This includes failures such as service process crashes, or a
temporary loss of network access. The service automatically restores normal
operation when the crashed process restarts automatically or when the network
access is restored.

However, more severe failure modes, such as losing a single node entirely,
require more drastic recovery measures. Losing an entire node or a virtual
machine could happen for example due to hardware failure or a severe software
failure.

A failing node is automatically detected by the MST monitoring infrastructure.
Either the node starts reporting that its own self-diagnostics is reporting
problems or the node stops communicating entirely. The monitoring infrastructure
automatically schedules a new replacement node to be created when this happens.

<highlight type="note">
In case of database failover, the service URL of your service remains the same,
only the IP address changes to point at the new master node.
</highlight>

Managed Service for TimescaleDB availability features differ based on the service
plan:

*   Basic and Dev plans: These are single-node plans and with a two day backup history for Basic plan and with one day backup history for Dev plan
day for Dev backup histories.
*   Pro plans: These are two-node plans with a master and a standby for higher
availability, and three day backup histories.

### Single-node

In the Basic and Dev plans, if you lose the only node from the service, it immediately
starts the automatic process of creating a new replacement node. The new node
starts up, restores its state from the latest available backup, and resumes the
service. Because there was just a single node providing the service, the service
is unavailable for the duration of the restore operation. Also, any writes made
since the backup of the latest write-ahead log (WAL) file is lost. Typically
this time window is limited to either five minutes, or one WAL
file.

### Highly available nodes

In Pro plans, if a PostgreSQL standby fails, the master node keeps running
normally and provides normal service level to the client applications. When the
new replacement standby node is ready and synchronized with the master, it
starts replicating the master in real time and normal operation resumes.

If the PostgreSQL master fails, the combined information from the MST
monitoring infrastructure and the standby node is used to make a failover decision. On
the nodes, the open source monitoring daemon `PGLookout` in combination with the
information from the MST system infrastructure report the failover. If the master node is
down completely, the standby node promotes itself as the new master node and
immediately starts serving clients. A new replacement node is automatically
scheduled and becomes the new standby node.

If both master and standby nodes fail at the same time, two new nodes are
automatically scheduled for creation and become the new master and standby
nodes respectively. The master node restores itself from the latest available
backup, which means that there can be some degree of data loss involved. For example,
any writes made since the backup of the latest write-ahead log (WAL) file can be
lost.

The amount of time it takes to replace a failed node depends mainly on the cloud
region and the amount of data that needs to be restored. However, in the case of
services with two-node Pro plans the surviving node keeps serving clients even
during the recreation of the other node. This process is entirely automatic and requires
no manual intervention.

For backups and restoration, Managed Service for TimescaleDB uses the
open source backup daemon `PGHoard` that MST maintains. It makes real-time
copies of write-ahead log (WAL) files to an object store in a compressed and
encrypted format.

## Connection limits

Managed Service for TimescaleDB limits the maximum number of connections to each
service. The maximum number of allowed connections depends on your service plan.
To see the current connection limit for your service, navigate to the service
`Overview` tab and locate the `Connection Limit` section.

If you have a lot of clients or client threads connecting to your database, use
connection pooling to limit the number of connections. For more information
about connection pooling, see the
[connection pooling section][connection-pooling].

<highlight type="note">
If you have a high number of connections to your database, your service might
run more slowly, and could run out of memory. Remain aware of how many open
connections your have to your database at any given time.
</highlight>

If you require a higher maximum number of connections, but cannot use connection
pooling, contact the
[Timescale support team][timescale-support].

## Service termination protection

You can protect your services from accidentally being terminated, by enabling
service termination protection. When termination protection is enabled, you
cannot power down the service from the web console, the REST API, or with a
command-line client. To power down a protected service, you need to turn off
termination protection first. Termination protection does not interrupt service
migrations or upgrades.

To enable service termination protection, navigate to the service `Overview`
tab. Locate the `Termination protection` section, and toggle to enable
protection.

<highlight type="important">
If you run out of free sign-up credit, and have not entered a valid credit card
for payment, your service is powered down, even if you have enabled termination
protection.
</highlight>

## Idle connections

Managed Service for TimescaleDB uses the default keep alive settings for TCP
connections. The default settings are:

*   `tcp_keepalives_idle`: 7200
*   `tcp_keepalive_count`: 9
*   `tcp_keepalives_interval`: 75

If you have long idle database connection sessions, you might need to adjust
these settings to ensure that your TCP connection remains stable. If you
experience a broken TCP connection, when you reconnect make sure that your
client resolves the DNS address correctly, as the underlying address changes
during automatic failover.

For more information about adjusting keep alive settings, see the
[PostgreSQL documentation][pg-keepalive].

## Long running queries

Managed Service for TimescaleDB does not cancel database queries. If you
have created a query that is taking a very long time, or that has hung, it could
lock resources on your service, and could prevent database administration tasks
from being performed.

You can find out if you have any long-running queries by navigating to the
service `Current Queries` tab. You can also cancel long running queries from
this tab.

Alternatively, you can use your connection client to view running queries with
this command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE state <> 'idle';
```

Cancel long-running queries using this command, with the PID of the query you
want to cancel:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<PID>);
```

If you want to automatically cancel any query that runs over a specified length
of time, you can use this command:

```sql
SET statement_timeout = <milliseconds>
```
