# Integrate Managed Service for TimescaleDB and Grafana

You can integrate Managed Service for TimescaleDB with Grafana to visualize your
data. Grafana service in MST has built-in Prometheus, PostgreSQL, Jaeger, and
other data source plugins that allow you to query and visualize data from a
compatible database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

*   Created a service in your Managed Service for TimescaleDB account
*   Created a service for Grafana

## Configure Managed Service for TimescaleDB as a data source

You can configure a TimescaleDB service as a data source to a Grafana service
to query and visualize the data from the database.
