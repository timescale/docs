## Create your first service

A service in Managed Service for TimescaleDB is a cloud instance on your chosen
cloud provider, which you can install your database on.

<Procedure>

### Creating your first service

1.  Sign in to the [Managed Service for TimescaleDB portal][mst-portal].
1.  Click `Create a new service`, and complete these details:
    *   In the `Select Your Service` field, click `TimescaleDB`.
    *   In the `Select Your Cloud Service Provider` field, click your
        preferred provider.
    *   In the `Select Your Cloud Service Region` field, click your preferred
        server location. This is often the server that's physically closest
        to you.
    *   In the `Select Your Service Plan` field, click your preferred plan,
        based on the hardware configuration you require. If you are in your
        trial period, and just want to try the service out, or develop a proof
        of concept, we recommend the `Dev` plan, because it is the most
        cost-effective during your trial period.
1.  In the information bar on the right of the screen, review the settings you
    have selected for your service, and click `Create Service`. The service
    takes a few minutes to provision.

</Procedure>

## Connect to your service from the command prompt

When you have a service up and running, you can connect to it from your local
system using the `psql` command-line utility. This is the same tool you might
have used to connect to PostgreSQL before, but if you haven't installed it yet,
check out our [installing psql][install-psql] section.

<Procedure>

### Connecting to your service from the command prompt

1.  Sign in to the [Managed Service for TimescaleDB portal][mst-portal].
1.  In the `Services` tab, find the service you want to connect to, and check
    it is marked as `Running`.
1.  Click the name of the service you want to connect to see the connection
    information. Take a note of the `host`, `port`, and `password`.
1.  On your local system, at the command prompt, connect to the service, using
    your own service details:

    ```bash
    psql -x "postgres://tsdbadmin:<PASSWORD>@<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/defaultdb?sslmode=require"
    ```

    If your connection is successful, you'll see a message like this, followed
    by the `psql` prompt:

    ```bash
    psql (13.3, server 13.4)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    defaultdb=>
    ```

</Procedure>

## Check that you have the TimescaleDB extension

TimescaleDB is provided as an extension to your PostgreSQL database, and it is
enabled by default when you create a new service on Managed Service for
TimescaleDB. You can check that the TimescaleDB extension is installed by using
the `\dx` command at the `psql` prompt. It looks like this:

```sql
defaultdb=> \dx
