## Request an extension

You can request an extension not on the list by contacting Support. In your
request, specify the database service and user database where you want to use
the extension.

Untrusted language extensions are not supported. This restriction preserves our
ability to offer the highest possible service level. An example of an untrusted
language extension is `plpythonu`.

You can contact Support directly from Managed Service for TimescaleDB. Click the
life-preserver icon in the upper-right corner of your dashboard.
