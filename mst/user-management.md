# User Management

You can add new users, and manage existing users, in the Managed Service for
TimescaleDB console. New users can be added to an entire project, or a single
service.

## Project members

You can invite new users to join your project as project members. There are
several roles available for project members:

|Role|Invite more users|Modify billing information|Manage existing services|Start and stop services|View service information|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Admin|✅|✅|✅|✅|✅|
|Operator|❌|❌|✅|✅|✅|
|Developer|✅|❌|✅|❌|✅|
|Read-only|❌|❌|❌|❌|✅|

Users who can manage existing services can create databases and connect to them,
on a service that already exists. To create a new service, users need the start
and stop services permission.

<Procedure>

### Adding project members

1.  [Log in to your account][mst-login]. By default, you start in the
    `Services` view, showing any services you currently have in your project.
1.  Check that you are in the project that you want to change the members for,
    and click `Members`.
1.  In the `Project members` page, type the email address of the member you want
    to add, and select a role for the member.
1.  Click `Send invitation`.
1.  The new user is sent an email inviting them to the project, and the invite
    shows in the `Pending invitations` list. You can click `Withdraw invitation`
    to remove an invitation before it has been accepted.
1.  When they accept the invitation, the user details show in the `Members`
    list. You can edit a member role by selecting a new role in the list. You
    can delete a member by clicking the delete icon in the list.

</Procedure>

## Service users

By default, when you create a new service, a new `tsdbadmin` user is created.
This is the user that you use to connect to your new service.

The `tsdbadmin` user is the owner of the database, but is not a superuser. To
access features requiring a superuser, log in as the `postgres` user instead.

On Managed Service for TimescaleDB services, the `tsdbadmin` user can:

*   Create a database
*   Create a role
*   Perform replication
*   Bypass row level security (RLS)

This allows you to use the `tsdbadmin` user to create another user with any
other roles. For a complete list of roles available, see the
[PostgreSQL role attributes documentation][pg-roles-doc].

Your service must be running before you can manage users.

<Procedure>

### Adding service users

1.  [Log in to your account][mst-login]. By default, you start in the
    `Services` view, showing any services you currently have in your project.
1.  Click the name of the service that you want to add users to, and navigate
    to the `Users` tab.
1.  In the `Username` field, type a name for your user. If you want to allow
    the user to be replicated, toggle `Allow replication`. Click
    `Add service user` to save the user.
1.  The new user shows in the `Username` list. You can view the password by
    clicking the eye icon. Use the options in the list to change the replication
    setting and password, or delete the user.

## Multi-factor user authentication

You can use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to your Managed Service
for TimescaleDB account. This requires an authentication code, provided by the
Google Authenticator app on your mobile device.

You can see which authentication method is in use by each member of your Managed
Service for TimescaleDB project. From the dashboard, navigate to the `Members`
section. Each member is listed in the table with an authentication method of
either `Password` or `Two-Factor`.

Before you begin, install the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device.
For more information, and installation instructions, see
[the Google Authenticator documentation][install-google-authenticator].

<Procedure>

### Configuring multi-factor authentication

1.  [Log in to your account][mst-login].
1.  Click the `User information` icon in the top-right of the dashboard to go to
    the `User profile` section.
1.  In the `Authentication` tab, toggle `Two-factor authentication` to
    `Enabled`, and enter your password.
1.  On your mobile device, open the Google Authenticator app, tap `+` and select
    `Scan a QR code`.
1.  On your mobile device, scan the QR code provided by Managed Service for
    TimescaleDB.
1.  In your Managed Service for TimescaleDB dashboard, enter the confirmation
    code provided by the Google Authenticator app, and click
    `Enable Two-Factor Auth`.

</Procedure>

<Highlight type="warning">
If you lose access to the mobile device you use for multi-factor
authentication, you cannot sign in to your Managed Service for TimescaleDB
account. To regain access to your account, on the login screen, click
`Forgot password?` and follow the step to reset your password. When you have
regained access to your account, reconfigure multi-factor authentication.

## User authentication tokens

Every time a registered user logs in, Managed Service for TimescaleDB creates a
new authentication token. This occurs for login events using the portal, and
using the API. By default, authentication tokens expire after 30 days, but the
expiry date is adjusted every time the token is used. This means that tokens can
be used indefinitely, if the user logs in at least every 30 days.

You can see the list of all current authentication tokens in the Managed Service
for TimescaleDB dashboard. [Log in to your account][mst-login], and click the
`User information` icon in the top-right of the dashboard to go to the
`User profile` section. In the `Authentication` tab, the table lists all current
authentication tokens.

When you make authentication changes, such as enabling two factor authentication
or resetting a password, all existing tokens are revoked. In some cases, a new
token is immediately created so that the web console session remains valid. You
can also manually revoke authentication tokens from the `User profile` page
individually, or click `Revoke all tokens` to revoke all current tokens.

Additionally, you can click `Generate token` to create a new token. When you
generate a token on this page, you can provide a description, maximum age, and
an extension policy. Generating authentication tokens in this way allows you to
use them with monitoring applications that make automatic API calls to Managed
Service for TimescaleDB.

<Highlight type="important">
There is a limit to how many valid authentication tokens are allowed per user.
This limit is different for tokens that are created as a result of a sign in
operation, and for tokens created explicitly. For automatically created tokens,
the system automatically deletes the oldest tokens as new ones are created. For
explicitly created tokens, older tokens are not deleted unless they expire or
are manually revoked. This can result in explicitly created tokens that stop
working, even though they haven't expired or been revoked. To avoid this, make
sure you sign out at the end of every user session, instead of just discarding
your authentication token. This is especially important for automation tools
that automatically sign in.
