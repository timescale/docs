# VPC Peering with AWS in Timescale Forge

Timescale Forge allows you to create a private network peering connection between
your cloud VPC and the Timescale Forge cloud infrastructure where your Timescale
services are hosted.

VPC peering isolates your Timescale Forge services ensuring that they are only
accessible via your peered VPC, offering greater security due to a reduced
attack vector surface.

The Timescale Forge console makes creating and configuring your VPC peering connections
simple. It provides controls for adding and removing VPC peering connections, migrating
services to and from VPCs, and creating new services with VPC peering attachments.

## Requirements and limitations
To use Timescale Forge VPC peering, you need your own cloud VPC, where your
applications and infrastructure are already running.

If you do not have administrative access to your cloud provider account, you will need
to work with someone from your team with sufficient permissions to:

- accept VPC peering requests,
- configure route table rules,
- configure security group and firewall rules.

<highlight type="tip">
The Timescale Forge VPC peering feature is currently limited to AWS VPC peering only.
</highlight>

<highlight type="tip">
Timescale Forge defaults to a limit of 3 VPCs per project. If you need more VPCs,
you may contact support to request a quota increase.
</highlight>

<highlight type="warning">
Once you have attached your Timescale Forge service to a VPC, it will no longer be accessible
via the public internet. It will only be accessible via your AWS VPC which has been peered
with your Timescale Forge VPC.
</highlight>

## Setup
Before you begin, log in to the [Timescale Forge console](https://console.forge.timescale.com/).

### Create a new VPC
In the Timescale Forge console, click `VPC` in the left navigation bar to go to the VPC
dashboard. You can add new VPCs here for your Timescale Forge services to attach to.
The VPCs created here are peered with your own VPC as part of the setup process.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/vpc-dashboard.png" alt="Navigate to the VPC dashboard in the console"/>

Click `Create VPC`, type a name for your new VPC, and provide an IPv4 CIDR block
(E.G., `10.0.0.0/16` or `192.168.0.0/24`). Make sure that the CIDR block you
choose for your VPC does not overlap with the cloud VPC you are using to create
a peering connection. If the CIDR blocks overlap, the peering process will fail.
You can always find the CIDR block of your AWS VPC from the AWS console.

<highlight type="tip">
VPC peering can be enabled for free during your Timescale Forge trial, but you will be
required to enter a valid payment method in order to create a VPC (even though you
will not yet be charged for it).
</highlight>

### Create a peering connection
When you have created a Timescale Forge VPC, you are ready to create a peering connection
between your Forge VPC and your cloud VPC. To do this, expand the dropdown menu by clicking
the `VPC Peering` column on your Forge VPC.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/create-peering-connection.png" alt="Expand the VPC Peering dropdown menu and enter info"/>

From this menu, enter the AWS Account ID, AWS VPC ID, and AWS region of your
cloud VPC for the new peering connection. When you have entered the correct
information, click `Add peering connection` to begin the peering process.

This process is asynchronous, and results in a peering connection sent to your
AWS account for you to accept. This is an important safety mechanism â€” never
accept a peering connection from an unknown account. All Timescale Forge
peering connections are sent from the AWS account `142548018081`.

Navigate to the AWS console's
[Peering Connections](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#PeeringConnections:)
dashboard. Find the new peering connection request sent from Timescale Forge, and
accept the request.

<highlight type="tip">
Make note of the peering connection ID (starting with `pcx-`) as it is used in the next step.
</highlight>

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/aws-accept-peering-connection.png" alt="Accept peering connection in AWS console after verifying requestor account number"/>

### Network routing and security
Once you have accepted the peering connection, the two VPCs will now be peered;
however, in order to use this peering connection, you need to update your
VPC's route table to include the CIDR block of your peered Timescale Forge VPC,
and you also need to update your VPC's security groups.

#### Route table
Within the AWS console, navigate to the
[Route Tables](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#RouteTables:sort=routeTableId)
dashboard. Select the route table corresponding to your VPC. From the detail menu, select
the `Routes` tab and click the `Edit routes` button.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/aws-route-table-routes.png" alt="The AWS Route Tables dashboard with Routes tab expanded"/>

From this view, click `Add route`. In the `Destination` column of the new row,
enter the CIDR block of the Timescale Forge VPC for which the peering connection
was configured in the previous few steps.

In the `Target` column, enter the peering connection ID (starting with `pcx-`)
noted in the previous step where you created the peering connection.

No other configuration is needed here, so click `Save routes`. This
configuration allows network traffic to flow from your VPC, across the peering
connection, and over to the Timescale Forge VPC where your Timescale services reside.

#### Security groups
Within the AWS console, navigate to the
[Security Groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#securityGroups:)
dashboard. From this view, click `Create security group` to create a new security group.

<highlight type="tip">
If you need to, you can use another security group which already exists in your VPC,
however, for simplicity we will assume the creation of a new security group.
</highlight>

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/aws-create-security-group.png" alt="The AWS Security Groups dashboard"/>

From the `Create security group` view, enter a name for your security group. Add whatever
content you would like to the description field. For the `VPC` field, select the VPC
which has been peered with your Forge VPC.

No inbound rules are required, so leave the inbound rules section empty.

In the outbound rules section, select `Custom TCP` for the rule type. The protocol
should remain as TCP. The port range should be `5432`, which is the port which will
be used to connect to your Timescale Forge services. The Destination should be set
to `Custom` and the value should be the CIDR block of your Forge VPC.

<highlight type="tip">
AWS may pre-populate the `Destination` column with the value `0.0.0.0/0`. Though this
value will certainly work, it is more "open" than needed, and should be deleted.
</highlight>

Finally, click `Create security group`. With this step, you will now be able to
connect to any of your Timescale Forge services attached to your peered VPC. In the next
section, you will learn how to create a Timescale Forge service with a VPC attachment.

## Create a service with VPC attachment
In the Timescale Forge console, navigate to the
[Services Dashboard](https://console.forge.timescale.com/dashboard/services). Click
`Create service` and select the compute and disk size which fits your needs.

Expand the dropdown menu under the `Select a VPC` step and select the VPC you created
previously. If you have multiple VPCs, select the VPC which you want your new service
to be attached to.

Click `Create Service`, and Timescale Forge will create your new service. Due to
selecting a VPC during setup, your new service will be created with an attachment to
your selected VPC.

## Migrating a service
Timescale Forge services may be migrated between VPCs within a Forge project, and may also
be migrated to and from the public network. Typically, once you have attached your service
to a VPC, it should remain attached to ensure that your applications running in your AWS
VPC will have continued connectivity to your service.

<highlight type="warning">
Timescale Forge uses a different DNS name for a Timescale service once it has been attached
to a VPC. This means that you will need to update your connection string if migrating a service
from the public internet into a VPC, or vice-versa.
</highlight>

To migrate a Timescale Forge service between VPCs, or to migrate to/from the public network,
navigate to the [Services Dashboard](https://console.forge.timescale.com/dashboard/services),
select the service you wish to migrate, click the `Operations` tab in the service details view,
and click the `VPC` tab within the `Operations` view. From this view, you have a few options
depending on the state of your service.

<highlight type="warning">
After migrating your Timescale Forge service, please allow a few minutes for DNS
propagation. If you receive DNS errors indicating that the DNS name could not be resolved,
this indicates that more time is needed for DNS propagation.
</highlight>

### Migrate from public network to VPC
When your service is attached to the public network, you have the option to select a VPC
to migrate your service into.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-public-to-vpc.png" alt="Migrate from public network to VPC"/>

Once you have selected the VPC to migrate your service into, click `Attach VPC`.
You will then be prompted to confirm the migration.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-public-to-vpc-confirm.png" alt="Confirm migration into VPC"/>

After confirming the migration, your service will be attached to the VPC you selected.
These operations are not immediate, and also involve DNS changes which may take a few
minutes to propagate.

As mentioned on the confirmation modal, you will need to update your connection string
in order to connect to your service after migration. The `Service URL` back on the
service details page is already updated to include the new DNS info, and should be used
for connecting to your service.

<highlight type="tip">
When migrating your service into a VPC, ensure that your AWS VPC's security groups
allow network access from your AWS VPC to the Forge VPC which your service has
migrated into. Security group configuration was previously covered as part of
peering connection setup. Double-check to be sure, otherwise you will not be able
to connect to your Timescale Forge service.
</highlight>

### Migrate between VPCs
When your service is already attached to a VPC, you have the option to migrate
it to another VPC within the same project.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-between-vpcs.png" alt="Migrate between VPCs"/>

To migrate between VPCs, expand the `Migrate into another VPC` menu and select the VPC
to migrate your service to. Then click `Migrate`. You will then be prompted to confirm
the migration.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-between-vpcs-confirm.png" alt="Migrate between VPCs confirmation"/>

After confirming the migration, your service will be detached from its previous VPC
and attached to the new VPC you selected.

In the case of VPC to VPC migration, the `Service URL` connection string will not
be updated, only the IP address which the DNS name is associated with will be updated.
Please provide a few minutes for the DNS record changes to propagate.

<highlight type="tip">
When migrating your service between VPCs, ensure that your AWS VPC's security groups
allow network access from your AWS VPC to the Forge VPC which your service has
migrated into. Security group configuration was previously covered as part of
peering connection setup. Double-check to be sure, otherwise you will not be able
to connect to your Timescale Forge service.
</highlight>

### Migrate back to public network
When your service is already attached to a VPC, you have the option to migrate
it back to the public network.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-back-to-public.png" alt="Migrate back to public network"/>

To migrate your service back to the public network, click `Migrate back to public network`.
You will then be prompted to confirm the migration.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.timescale.com/docs/images/timescale-forge/migrate-back-to-public-confirm.png" alt="Migrate back to public network confirm"/>

After confirming the migration, your service will be detached from its previous VPC
and made accessible over the public internet.

As mentioned on the confirmation modal, you will need to update your connection string
in order to connect to your service after migration. The `Service URL` back on the
service details page is already updated to include the new DNS info, and should be used
for connecting to your service.
