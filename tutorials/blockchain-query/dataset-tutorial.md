# The dataset

Provide a very short explanation of the dataset. Explain if it being created
from scratch, downloaded from a server and uploaded to the readers' own
database, or being accessed directly from a third-party service.

## Set up the dataset

This is the introduction to the procedure about setting up the dataset. Use one
or two sentences to explain the procedure. Note the simple verb form in the
title; the procedure itself uses the gerund-verb form (an `-ing` word) instead.

<Procedure>

### Setting up the dataset

1.  Start each step with a verb (create, use, install, etc) or a location (at
    the `psql` prompt, on your local filesystem, on the server, etc) followed by
    a verb.
1.  Do the next step:

   ```sql|bash|...
   Add any commands in a block like this.
   Make sure you specify the language.
   Do not include any prompts, or sudo commands. If root is required \
   state it in the step instead. Break long lines appropriately.
   ```

1.  Make sure that any action that is the result of the step stays with the step.
   For example: clicking a button, and a dialog box appearing, are a single step.
1.  Finish the procedure on the final step. Do not include a result statement.
