# Set up the database

This tutorial uses the energy consumption data for over a year in a
hypertable named `metrics`.

This tutorial uses the energy consumption data for over a year in a typical
household. You can use this data to analyze the energy consumption pattern.

## Create continuous aggregates

<Procedure>

### Creating continuous aggregates for energy consumption by day and hour

1.  Create a continuous aggregate `kwh_day_by_day` for energy consumption on a
    day to day basis:

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW kwh_day_by_day(time, value)
        with (timescaledb.continuous) as
    SELECT time_bucket('1 day', created, 'Europe/Berlin') AS "time",
            round((last(value, created) - first(value, created)) * 100.) / 100. AS value
    FROM metrics
    WHERE type_id = 5
    GROUP BY 1;
    ```

1.  Add a refresh policy to keep the continuous aggregate up-to-date:

     ```sql
     SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('kwh_day_by_day',
        start_offset => NULL,
        end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
        schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour');
     ```

1.  Create a continuous aggregate `kwh_hour_by_hour` for energy consumption on
    an hourly basis:

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW kwh_hour_by_hour(time, value)
      with (timescaledb.continuous) as
    SELECT time_bucket('01:00:00', metrics.created, 'Europe/Berlin') AS "time",
           round((last(value, created) - first(value, created)) * 100.) / 100. AS value
    FROM metrics
    WHERE type_id = 5
    GROUP BY 1;
    ```

1.  Add a refresh policy to keep the continuous aggregate up-to-date:

     ```sql
     SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('kwh_hour_by_hour',
        start_offset => NULL,
        end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
        schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour');
     ```

1.  You can confirm that the continuous aggregates were created:

    ```sql
    SELECT view_name, format('%I.%I', materialization_hypertable_schema,materialization_hypertable_name) AS materialization_hypertable
    FROM timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates;
    ```

    You should see this:

    ```sql
     view_name     |            materialization_hypertable
    ------------------+--------------------------------------------------
     kwh_day_by_day   | _timescaledb_internal._materialized_hypertable_2
     kwh_hour_by_hour | _timescaledb_internal._materialized_hypertable_3

    ```

The queries in this tutorial are suitable for visualizing in Grafana. If you
want to visualize the results of your queries, connect your Grafana account to
the energy consumption dataset.
