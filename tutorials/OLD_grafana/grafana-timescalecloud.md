# Connect TimescaleDB and Grafana

Grafana ships with built-in Prometheus, PostgreSQL, Jaeger, and other data
source plugins that allow you to query and visualize data from a compatible
database. To add a data source in Grafana you must be signed as a user with
organization administration role privileges.

To connect Grafana with Timescale, start by installing Grafana. For more
information about installing Grafana, see the
[Grafana documentation][grafana-install].

Alternatively, to connect your Grafana service on Managed Service for
TimescaleDB with your Timescale service, create a Grafana service on Managed
Service for TimescaleDB. You can try it for free for 30 days.

This section shows you how to connect Timescale as a data source in [Grafana][grafana-homepage].
