# How to simulate a basic IoT sensor dataset on PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a trend where computing is
becoming ubiquitous and is embedded in more and more physical things.
For many of these things, the purpose of IoT is to collect sensor data
about the environment in which it exists, for example oil wells, factories,
power plants, farms, moving vehicles, office buildings, homes.

In other words, IoT is all about the data. And the datasets generated by
these things are generally time-series in nature, with relational
metadata to describe those things.

Often, it is necessary to simulate IoT sensor data, for example, when
testing a new system. This tutorial shows how to simulate a
basic IoT sensor dataset on PostgreSQL, or TimescaleDB.

For creating a more advanced simulated IoT dataset, try the
[Time-series Benchmarking Suite (TSBS)](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need a cursory knowledge of the Structured Query
Language (SQL). The tutorial walks you through each SQL command, but it is
helpful if you've seen SQL before.

To start, [install TimescaleDB][install-timescale]. When your installation is
complete, you can ingest or create sample data and finish the tutorial.

## Set up your tables

First, connect to your database via `psql`.

Second, create the "sensors" and "sensor_data" tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  location VARCHAR(50)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  sensor_id INTEGER,
  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
  cpu DOUBLE PRECISION,
  FOREIGN KEY (sensor_id) REFERENCES sensors (id)
);
```

If you are using TimescaleDB, convert the `sensor_data` table into a
[`hypertable`][docs-hypertable]:

```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', 'time');
```

Fourth, populate the sensors table with 4 sensors:

```sql
INSERT INTO sensors (type, location) VALUES
('a','floor'),
('a', 'ceiling'),
('b','floor'),
('b', 'ceiling');
```

Fifth, verify that the sensors were created correctly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sensors;
```

After running that last SQL statement, you should see something like
this:

```
 id | type | location
----+------+----------
  1 | a    | floor
  2 | a    | ceiling
  3 | b    | floor
  4 | b    | ceiling
(4 rows)
```

## Create the simulated IoT sensor data

<Highlight type="note">
This section shows results of the queries as examples, but because the tutorial
generates random data every time it is run, your results look different, but is
structured the same way.
</Highlight>

Generate a dataset for all of our four sensors and insert into the `sensor_data`
table:

```sql
INSERT INTO sensor_data (time, sensor_id, cpu, temperature)
SELECT
  time,
  sensor_id,
  random() AS cpu,
  random()*100 AS temperature
FROM generate_series(now() - interval '24 hour', now(), interval '5 minute') AS g1(time), generate_series(1,4,1) AS g2(sensor_id);
```

Verify that the simulated sensor data was written correctly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sensor_data ORDER BY time;
```

Example output:

```
             time              | sensor_id |    temperature     |         cpu         
-------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+---------------------

```

Congratulations, you've created a basic IoT sensor dataset. Now let's run some
queries.

## Run basic queries (optional)

This section requires TimescaleDB.

### Average temperature, average cpu by 30 minute windows:

```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu
FROM sensor_data
GROUP BY period;
```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

```
         period         |     avg_temp     |      avg_cpu      
------------------------+------------------+-------------------
 2020-03-31 19:00:00+00 | 49.6615830013373 | 0.477344429974134
 2020-03-31 22:00:00+00 | 58.8521540844037 | 0.503637770501276
 2020-03-31 16:00:00+00 | 50.4250325243144 | 0.511075591299838
 2020-03-31 17:30:00+00 | 49.0742547437549 | 0.527267253802468
 2020-04-01 14:30:00+00 | 49.3416377226822 | 0.438027751864865
 ...
```

### Average & last temperature, average cpu by 30 minute windows:

But what if you don't just want the average temperature for each period,
but also the last temperature? For example if you wanted to understand
the final temperature value at the end of the interval:

```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
  last(temperature, time) AS last_temp,
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu
FROM sensor_data
GROUP BY period;
```

Example output:

```
         period         |     avg_temp     |    last_temp     |      avg_cpu      
------------------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------
 2020-03-31 19:00:00+00 | 49.6615830013373 | 84.3963081017137 | 0.477344429974134
 2020-03-31 22:00:00+00 | 58.8521540844037 | 76.5528806950897 | 0.503637770501276
 2020-03-31 16:00:00+00 | 50.4250325243144 | 43.5192013625056 | 0.511075591299838
 2020-03-31 17:30:00+00 | 49.0742547437549 |  22.740753274411 | 0.527267253802468
 2020-04-01 14:30:00+00 | 49.3416377226822 | 59.1331578791142 | 0.438027751864865
...
```

### Using the sensor metadata

Now let's take advantage of some of the metadata you have stored in the
`sensors` table:

```sql
SELECT
  sensors.location,
  time_bucket('30 minutes', time) AS period,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
  last(temperature, time) AS last_temp,
  AVG(cpu) AS avg_cpu
FROM sensor_data JOIN sensors on sensor_data.sensor_id = sensors.id
GROUP BY period, sensors.location;
```

Example output:

```
 location |         period         |     avg_temp     |     last_temp     |      avg_cpu
