# Analyze financial tick data with TimescaleDB

To analyze financial data, you can chart the open, high, low, close, and volume
(OHLCV) information for a financial asset. Using this data, you can create
candlestick charts that make it easier to analyze the price changes of financial
assets over time. You can use candlestick charts to examine trends in stock,
cryptocurrency, or NFT prices.

In this tutorial, you use real raw financial data provided by
[Twelve Data][twelve-data], create an aggregated candlestick view, query the
aggregated data, and visualize the data in Grafana.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial covers:

1.  [Set up up your dataset][financial-tick-dataset]: Load data from
    [Twelve Data][twelve-data] into your TimescaleDB database.
1.  [Query your dataset][financial-tick-query]: Create candlestick views, query

## About OHLCV data and candlestick charts

The financial sector regularly uses [candlestick charts][charts] to visualize
the price change of an asset. Each candlestick represents a time period, such as
one minute or one hour, and shows how the asset's price changed during that time.

Candlestick charts are generated from the open, high, low, close, and volume
data for each financial asset during the time period. This is often abbreviated
as OHLCV:

*   Open: opening price
*   High: highest price
*   Low: lowest price
*   Close: closing price
*   Volume: volume of transactions
