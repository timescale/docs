Chunks are tiered asynchronously. Chunks are selected to be tiered to the object storage tier one at a time ordered by their enqueue time.

To see the chunks waiting to be tiered query the `timescaledb_osm.chunks_queued_for_tiering` view

```sql
select count(*) from timescaledb_osm.chunks_queued_for_tiering
```

Processing all the chunks in the queue may take considerable time if a large quantity of data is being migrated to the object storage tier.
