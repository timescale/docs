You might see this error message in the logs if background workers aren't
properly configured.

To fix this error, make sure that `max_worker_processes`,
`max_parallel_workers`, and `timescaledb.max_background_workers` are properly
set. `timescaledb.max_background_workers` should equal the number of databases
plus the number of concurrent background workers. `max_worker_processes` should
equal the sum of `timescaledb.max_background_workers` and
`max_parallel_workers`.

For more information, see the [worker configuration docs][worker-config].
