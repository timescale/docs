Materialized views are generally used with ordered data. If you insert historic
data, or data that is not related to the current time, you need to refresh
policies and reevaluate the values that are dragging from past to present.

You can set up an after insert rule for your hypertable or upsert to trigger
something that can validate what needs to be refreshed as the data is merged.

Let's say you inserted ordered timeframes named A, B, D, and F, and you already
have a continuous aggregation looking for this data. If you now insert E, you
need to refresh E and F.  However, if you insert C we'll need to refresh C, D, E
and F.

For example:

1. A, B, D, and F are already materialized in a view with all data.
1. To insert C, split the data into `AB` and `DEF` subsets.
1. `AB` are consistent and the materialized data is too; you only need to
    reuse it.
1. Insert C, `DEF`, and refresh policies after C.

This can use a lot of resources to process, especially if you have any important
data in the past that also needs to be brought to the present.

Consider an example where you have 300 columns on a single hypertable and use,
for example, five of them in a continuous aggregation. In this case, it could
be hard to refresh and would make more sense to isolate these columns in another
hypertable. Alternatively, you might create one hypertable per metric and
refresh them independently.
