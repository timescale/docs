If you attempt to create a hierarchical continuous aggregate, you must use
compatible time buckets. You can't create a continuous aggregate with a
fixed-width time bucket on top of a continuous aggregate with a variable-width
time bucket. For more information, see the restrictions section in
[hierarchical continuous aggregates][h-caggs-restrictions].
