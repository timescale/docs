When you drop a chunk, it requires an exclusive lock. If a chunk is being
accessed by another session, you cannot drop the chunk at the same time. If a
drop chunk operation can't get the lock on the chunk, then it times out and the
process fails. To resolve this problem, check what is locking the chunk. In some
cases, this could be caused by a continuous aggregate or other process accessing
the chunk. When the drop chunk operation can get an exclusive lock on the chunk,
it completes as expected.

For more information about locks, see the
[PostgreSQL lock monitoring documentation][pg-lock-monitoring].
