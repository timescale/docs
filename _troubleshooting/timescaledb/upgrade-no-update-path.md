In some cases, when you use the `ALTER EXTENSION timescaledb UPDATE` command to
upgrade, it might fail with the above error.

This occurs if the list of available extensions does not include the version you
are trying to upgrade to, and it can occur if the package was not installed
correctly in the first place. To correct the problem, install the upgrade
package, restart PostgreSQL, verify the version, and then attempt the upgrade
again.
