Managed Service for TimescaleDB services require a DNS record. When you launch a
new service the DNS record is created, and it can take some time for the new
name to propagate to DNS servers around the world.

If you move an existing service to a new Cloud provider or region, the service
is rebuilt in the new region in the background. When the service has been
rebuilt in the new region, the DNS records are updated. This could cause a short
interruption to your service while the DNS changes are propagated.

If you are unable to resolve DNS, wait a few minutes and try again.
