You might see this error when using the `ALTER TABLE` command to change the
ownership of tables or hypertables.

This use of `ALTER TABLE` is blocked because the `tsdbadmin` user is not a
superuser.

To change table ownership, use the [`REASSIGN`][sql-reassign] command instead:

```sql
REASSIGN OWNED BY <current_role> TO <desired_role>
```

[sql-reassign]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reassign-owned.html
