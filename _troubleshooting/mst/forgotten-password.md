It happens to us all, you want to login to MST Console, and the password is somewhere 
next to your keys, wherever they are. 

To reset your password:

1. Open [MST Portal][mst-login].
2. Click `Forgot password`.
3. Enter your email address, then click `Reset password`.

A secure reset password link is sent to the email associated with this account. Click the link 
and update your password.
