If you attempt to compress or decompress a chunk with a non-privileged user
account, you might get this error. To compress or decompress a chunk, your user
account must have permissions that allow it to perform `CREATE INDEX` on the
chunk. You can check the permissions of the current user with this command at
the `psql` command prompt:

```sql
\dn+ <USERNAME>
```

To resolve this problem, grant your user account the appropriate privileges with
this command:

```sql
GRANT PRIVILEGES
    ON TABLE <TABLE_NAME>
    TO <ROLE_TYPE>;
```

For more information about the `GRANT` command, see the
[PostgreSQL documentation][pg-grant].
