Promscale creates a table for each metric. When you run `pg_dump` and
`pg_restore`, they lock each table to work on it. This can require a lot of
locks in a single transaction, which can quickly grow higher than the maximum
number of locks allowed. If the number of locks required exceeds the number
allowed, Promscale gives an `out of shared memory` error, and the action is
aborted.

To fix this error, increase the `max_locks_per_transaction` setting in the
PostgreSQL configuration file, so that `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` can create the
required number of locks, and the backup or restore can continue.

<highlight type="important">
You need to restart PostgreSQL to pick up changes to the
`max_locks_per_transaction` parameter.

You can use this query to calculate the new minimum value to use for
`max_locks_per_transaction`:

```SQL
WITH max_objects_touched AS (
        SELECT 400 + count(*) as max_objects_touched
        FROM pg_class
                 JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = pg_class.relnamespace
        WHERE n.nspname <> 'pg_catalog'
          AND n.nspname !~ '^pg_toast'
          AND n.nspname <> 'information_schema'
    ),
    max_conns AS (
        SELECT SUM(setting::INTEGER) as max_conns FROM pg_settings WHERE name IN ('max_connections', 'max_prepared_transactions')
    )
SELECT max_objects_touched/max_conns AS max_locks_per_transaction FROM max_objects_touched, max_conns;
```
