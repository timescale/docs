 When the `pg_dump` tool tries to acquire a lock on the `job_errors` 
 table, if the user doesn't have the required SELECT permission, it 
 results in this error.

To resolve this issue, use a superuser account to grant the necessary 
permissions to the user requiring the `pg_dump` tool.
Use this command to grant permissions to `<TEST_USER>`:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE _timescaledb_internal.job_errors TO <TEST_USER>;
```
