When you migrate a PostgreSQL database to Timescale using the Hypershift tool,
the migration can run very slowly if you do not have an index on the `time`
column. Hypershift uses the index to determine how to perform the migration. It
uses the index to break the database into parts that is can copy in parallel.
Additionally, if you have compression enabled on the destination table,
Hypershift can compress each part immediately after it is copied, which uses
less storage during the migration. Without an index, Hypershift attempts to copy
the entire table at once instead. To resolve this problem, create a btree index
on the `time` column. However, creating an index can take some time, as the
entire table needs to be read from disk. You can create the btree index with
this command:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON "<TABLE_NAME>" USING btree (time);
```

<highlight type="important">
Hypershift is not able to efficiently copy and compress data when the only
index is a composite index where `time` is not the first indexed column. If you
already have such a composite index, ensure that your source database has a
plain index before you run the Hypershift migration.
